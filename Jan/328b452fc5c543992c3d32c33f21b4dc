They were said to have visited the Bishop on several occasions to beg for forgiveness but to no avail. Also, catholic priests from Awgu, Awka, Enugu and outside the country had pleaded for justice and mercy as well as urging the restoration of the suspended clerics without success. Also, a cross section of the catholic faithful at Awgu are of the opinion that no matter the offence they committed, they are supposed to be pardoned, especially as the priests had pleaded for leniency. During the year of Mercy, Pope Francis had asked everyone to forgive whatever offence anyone must have committed. Efforts to get the bishop’s reaction failed as he did not pick calls.
