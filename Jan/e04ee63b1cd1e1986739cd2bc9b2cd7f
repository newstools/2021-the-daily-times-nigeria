The Ebonyi State Government has described the killing of three police officers by unknown gunmen at Onueke Police Station in Ezza-South Local Government Area of the state on Friday as “shocking and disheartening.” The Commissioner for Internal Security, Mr Stanley Emegha condemned the act in an interview in Abakaliki on Sunday. Two male inspectors of police and a female officer were involved in the incident. Emegha urged security agencies to investigate the matter and bring the perpetrators to book. “The incident is an act of terrorism and Ebonyi people are not known for terrorism. The act is condemnable and not acceptable to the state government. “We are still waiting for the police to brief us on what happened; we have given the officers 48 hours on that while investigation is ongoing,” the commissioner stated. The Police Public Relation Officer, Ebonyi Command, DSP Loveth Odah confirmed that unknown gunmen invaded the station, killing three officers.
