*Hails US President for lifting immigration visa restrictions on Nigerians Tunde Opalana, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended United States President Joe Biden for lifting the immigration visa restrictions on Nigerians but urged him to impose firm sanctions on leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and officials of the Buhari administration involved in acts of corruption, patronizing of terrorists, and undermining Nigeria’s democracy. The party also entreated the new US leader to take drastic measures to freeze the assets of such APC leaders and officials of the Buhari administration in the United States, while ensuring that the lifting of visa ban does not extend to such individuals. Party publicist, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement Sunday said “now that President Biden has settled down to work, our party urges him to look into the records, especially the report of the Department of State and note the litany of infractions on our polity by APC leaders and officials of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.

In that vein, we urge President Biden to announce strong sanctions against those who invaded our courts as well as the chambers of our Senate where they disrupted parliamentary session and carted away the mace. “It is indeed sickening that the same individual who ought to be in jail for leading the invasion of our Senate chamber is shamelessly presiding over the proceedings of the Senate under Buhari’s watch”. Furthermore, the PDP urged President Biden to assist the country in the recovery of over N15 trillion stolen by APC leaders including the N9.6 trillion detailed in the leaked NNPC report as well as the over N6 trillion stolen in various ministries, agencies and departments of government under the Buhari administration. President Biden is also called upon to impress it on President Buhari to vanquish terrorists, bandits and kidnappers ravaging our nation by rejigging our security architecture and replacing his wearied service chiefs with more competent hands.
