A Shari’a Court sitting in Rigasa, Kaduna State, on Tuesday ordered a man, Ibrahim Aliyu, to get a job by April 18 in order to sustain his family. Earlier, in a petition, a 45-year-old businesswoman, Fatima Lawal, approached the court, seeking an order compelling Aliyu to get a job. Delivering judgment, Justice Salisu Abubakar-Tureta, said: ”if he fails to get a job or start a business before the adjourned date, the court will dissolve the marriage as prayed by his wife”.

But since he died two years ago, my husband has refused to get a job. ”My mother stepped in help us. I am tired. The responsibility is too much on me. I want him to change and be responsible but if he refuses, I will leave him,” she said. In his defence, Aliyu said that things changed for the worst, when the Kasuwan Barci market was demolished. ”I lost my means of livelihood. I am ready to get a job and start providing for my family,” he said.
