He said his team were prepared to take the three points but unfortunately had to make do with a draw, which he said was not a bad result. “Rangers are a good side and with this result our players’ confidence will be high ahead of our next match, which is at home against Abia Warriors, ” Dogo said. Salisu Yusuf, the Rangers coach, on his part said the result was not all that bad, saying “a draw is better than a loss”. He however said the ongoing season was looking to be the best so far because teams have been getting positive results at away matches. ”We defeated Jigawa Golden Stars away and drew 1-1 against MFM FC. So, we can still get more good results at away venues to make up for this one.” Yusuf noted that the match’s officiating was faultless, saying the referee did his best as a human being and he (Yusuf) had nothing to complain about the officiating. He however pointed out that their opponents made the game difficult by not allowing the game to flow. “Maybe that is their tactic, and it worked out for them perfectly.”
