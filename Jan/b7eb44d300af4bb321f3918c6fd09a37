Nigerian Stock Exchange market capitalisation on Friday dropped further by N51 billion on sustained profit-taking due to fear of rate adjustment by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The MPC of the Central Bank of Nigeria first meeting of year has been slated for Jan. 25 and Jan. 26. Specifically, the market capitalisation lost N51 billion or 0.24 per cent to close at N21.448 trillion compared with N21.499 trillion posted on Thursday. Also, the All-Share Index which opened at 41,099.15 shed 97.16 points or 0.24 per cent to close at 41,001.99. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the persistent bearish trend to fear of likely rate cut by MPC. “Historically, February is a dicey month for the stock market, despite being the period for early filers of full year earnings reports. “The recent slow or profit booking is as a result of positive close of 2020 and fear of rate adjustment at the forthcoming MPC meeting, ahead of earnings reporting season,” Omordion said. He said that the fear was heightened by the latest FGN Bonds which reopened on adjusted and juicier rates for long tenored bonds. Omordion noted that the relative stability in the market was due to dominance of domestic institutional investors.
