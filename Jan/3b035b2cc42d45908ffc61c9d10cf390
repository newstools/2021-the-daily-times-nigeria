Tunde Opalana, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has debunked rumour of recruitment of personnel into the Commission. National Commissioner & Chairman Information and Voter Education, Barr Festus Okoye, said the purported recruitment is being orchestrated by “fake employment merchants and racketeers who open fake employment websites, collect money from unsuspecting members of the public and issue fake employment letters” purporting to be acting on behalf of the Commission. In a statement on Friday, Okoye recalled that on the 30th of May 2020, the Commission issued a statement drawing the attention of the public to the circulation of purported letters of employment/appointment allegedly emanating from it. The National Commissioner said “we had informed members of the public that the Commission suspended its recruitment programme. We advised everyone to discountenance all rumours of recruitment and letters of employment/recruitment purportedly emanating from the Commission and duly informed the security agencies of the scam.

The recruitment of fresh graduates and experienced professionals has since been suspended. “The Commission is a public trust and has always conducted its activities in the best tradition of openness and transparency. This policy of transparency informs the wide publicity given to its recruitment drive any time the Commission embarks on such”. The electoral umpire, therefore, called on the public to be conscious of the antics of fraudsters and not to fall victim to their criminal activities.
