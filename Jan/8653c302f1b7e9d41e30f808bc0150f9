The equities market of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed 2020 with 50.03 per cent growth, with the All-Share Index crossing the 40, 000 marks on the last trading day of the year. Specifically, the All-Share Index which opened trading for the year at 26, 842.07 rose by 13, 428.65 points or 50.03 per cent to close at 40, 270.72. Also, the market capitalisation rose by N8.098 trillion to close at N21.056 trillion from the opening year figure of N12.958 trillion. According to analysts, the market was positively impacted by policies introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which favoured the stock market. They noted that the apex bank policies impacted positively on Nigerian stocks, with the stock market recording the highest growth in six years. The Nigerian equities benchmark index in Africa’s largest economy recorded its highest return in 2020, the best among 93 equity indexes it tracked. Consequently, it emerged as the world’s best-performing stock market year-to-date. Commenting on the market performance, Uche Uwaleke, a financial economist and Professor of Capital Market at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, described 2020 as a year of a bumper harvest. “The major reason is the fact that other competing asset classes such as fixed-income securities lost their attractiveness owing to CBN policies which lowered yields. “Naturally, investors preference shifted to the riskier equities market that offered returns higher than the inflation rate. “The way to sustain the momentum is for the CBN to continue to ensure a low-interest-rate environment through accommodative monetary policies that tend to support economic growth,’’ Uwaleke said.
