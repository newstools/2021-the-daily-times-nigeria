By Tunde Opalana & Kamarudeen Ogundele President Muhammadu Buhari has communicated the appointment of the service chiefs to the Senate, seeking their confirmation. A statement issued on Friday by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Senator Babajide Omoworare, said Buhari had requested the confirmation of the service chiefs by the Senate through his letter to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, dated January 27. He said this was done in furtherance to Section 18 (1) of the Armed Forces Act. According to him, contrary to fears expressed in some quarters that Buhari has by-passed the National Assembly in the process of appointing the service chiefs and that he has no intention of seeking the consideration and confirmation of their appointment, the President upon their nomination for appointment sought the confirmation of the Senate for the appointment of the new service chiefs. The new service chiefs are Chief of Defence Staff, Major-General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, General Ibrahim Attahiru; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo and Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao The statement said further: “It is on record that this same procedure was adopted when the immediate past service chiefs were appointed. Upon announcement of the appointment of the then service chiefs – Major General Abayomi Olonisakin (Chief of Defence Staff ), Major General Tukur Buratai (Chief of Army Staff ), Rear Admiral IbokEfe Ibas (Chief of Naval Staff ) and Air Vice Marshal Sadique Abubakar (Chief of Air Staff ), Mr. President had written the 8th Senate on 14th July, 2015 for confirmation. “Whilst the correspondence was read on the floor of the Senate on 28th July, 2015, consideration and confirmation of the appointments was carried out at the Committee of the Whole on 4th August 2015. “It will be recalled that the National Assembly will only resume plenary sessions on 9th February 2021, when hopefully, Mr. President’s communication for consideration and confirmation of the nominations for appointment of the service chiefs would be undertaken.

We are in compliance with the spirit and letters of both the statute and case law,” the statement added.
