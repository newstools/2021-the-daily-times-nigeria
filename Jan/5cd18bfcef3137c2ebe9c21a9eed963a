Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (retd.), the immediate past Chief of Army Staff says the former President Olusegun Obasanjo nearly retired him at the rank of Major, 21 years ago. Buratai, who revealed this during his official handover to his successor, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru at the Army Headquarters on Thursday, January 28, 2021, did not explain the reason why the ex-president wanted to retire him. Describing his attainment of the rank of Lieutenant General and Chief of Army Staff as historic, Buratai said, “the Army will never remain the same due to my transformational leadership and landmark achievements”. “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo almost retired me 21 years ago when I was a Major. My retirement after 40 years of service is historic, hence, calls for gratitude,” he said. He also said the Nigerian Army has been “better positioned with intelligence gathering techniques and equipment”.
