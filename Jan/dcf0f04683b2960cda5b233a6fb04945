By Tunde Opalana Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the 2021 New Year address by President Muhammadu Buhari as empty, without direction and confirms that the nation indeed has become leaderless. It said the President’s speech underscores the urgent need for compatriots to come together and salvage the nation that is fast heading to a failed state. In a new year message, the PDP lamented as appalling that on New Year day, all that President Buhari could offer a troubled and frustrated nation was a regurgitated script full of lame excuses and empty promises that address nothing. National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement Friday said “as a President, President Buhari has not demonstrated the capacity to play his own part, as he claimed, having failed to find solutions for the security and economic challenges that pervade our nation under his incompetent and lethargic watch. “The myriads of lame excuses in Mr. President’s address again underlines our national misfortune of a weak leadership that is unable to resolutely confront and vanquish bandits, terrorists, kidnappers and vandals who are now holding our nation hostage, ravaging our communities, kidnapping and beheading our compatriots without restrain. “The least Nigerians expected from Mr. President in the New Year was a decisive will to tackle our security challenges by reviewing his parade and heeding the demands by Nigerians to rejig our nation’s security architecture. “The situation at hand requires more than an armchair Commander -in -Chief who only dwells on excuses for manifest failures. President Buhari’s New Year address only points to the fact that our nation is in dire need of a leadership that is willing, able and ready to engage from the front. “On the economy, Mr. President failed to articulate a definite economic recovery blueprint. He had no clear strategies to shore up the value of our naira, repay and end our foreign borrowings, revamp our external reserves, give hope to foreign investors, move promises of job creation from the perpetual drawing board and guarantee food security, health care among others. “Mr. President had the opportunity to redeem his administration by taking steps that will address high costs of food, education and housing deficit, address the high price of fuel, multiple taxes and tariffs that bear pressure on businesses and families as well as how to enhance national productivity and grow our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). “In the same vein, our party finds it lamentable that President Buhari, in his reference to the demonstration by our youths, did not make any decisive pronouncement to end the on-going persecution of \EndSARS protesters or order a presidential inquest into the reported Lekki killing.

The PDP prayed that God will give compatriots the perseverance to outlive the pains of APC and President Buhari’s misrule as they work collectively for a new dawn.
