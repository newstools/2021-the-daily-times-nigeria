Trump had, following the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, relocated the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. The move sparked unrest across the entire Middle East. Blinken stressed that the U.S. embassy will remain in Jerusalem and the U.S. will continue to view the disputed city as the capital of Israel.
