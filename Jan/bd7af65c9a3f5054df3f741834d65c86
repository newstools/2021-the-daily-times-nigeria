The Chairman of NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri-Erewa while responding to the viral video depicting Nigerians pleading to be returned from Saudi Arabia assured that they will be evacuated from the Muslim country by January 28th and 29th. She attributed the delay to the coronavirus pandemic as both countries bickered over the responsibility of paying for COVID-19 tests. “I can’t confirm the video. However, I know that we have 600 Nigerians that are illegal migrants that would be leaving Saudi Arabia. “Yesterday we were with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, and other officials and plans have already been made to get them home before the end of the month pending any unforeseen circumstances,” the NIDCOM boss said.
