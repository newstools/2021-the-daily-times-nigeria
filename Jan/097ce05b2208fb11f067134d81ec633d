Egube further stated that a significant percentage of the projected IGR of N512 billion is expected to be contributed by the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS). “We shall achieve this by expanding the tax net by simplifying the tax process, improving our transaction taxes and the appropriate use of technology, and improving the work environment, training and tools of tax administration personnel. This will improve the efficiency in operations of all revenue-generating agencies,” the Commissioner said. He stated that the government believes that there are huge revenue opportunities in the state, including real estate, transportation sectors and markets among others, adding “We will continue to use data and intelligence to unravel revenue opportunities and leakages”.
