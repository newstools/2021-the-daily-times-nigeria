Tunde Opalana, Abuja Latching on the 2020 corruption index report on Nigeria by Transparency International (TI), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said it has been vindicated that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government is a citadel of corruption and the most corrupt administration in Nigeria. The PDP asserted that the TI report, which shows the country plunging to 149th on the corruption perception index in 2020; dropping 13 places since 2015, is an incontrovertible confirmation that the nation is more corrupt under President Buhari and the APC, than it was in 2015 when they took office. The party therefore, asked the ruling APC to commence the refund of an accumulated N15 trillion allegedly stollen by its leaders. Party publicist, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement Thursday said “this descent into the abyss of corruption only goes to show that President Buhari’s anti-corruption stance is a mere swindle used to delude Nigerians while the vaults were laid open for APC leaders and officials of the Buhari administration to plunder. “Indeed, the record of unbroken decline from 136th in 2016 to 144th in 2018, 146th in 2019 and now 149th in 2020, under President Buhari, the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion’, settles the now notorious fact that the Buhari administration and the APC are titleholders in corruption. “Nigerians can now see that what the APC and the Buhari Presidency did, upon assumption of office, was to simulate a holier than thou attitude, deploy the instrument of propaganda to deliberately castigate the PDP with false corruption allegations just to divert public attention and create a safe atmosphere for APC leaders to loot our nation to her knees. “The fact remains that no matter how lies and falsehood try to prevail, the truth will always come to light at the end of the day. “From the oil and inland revenue sectors to security, health, agriculture, food security, healthcare, transportation, road infrastructure, power, education, environment, among other critical sectors, none was spared from the kleptomaniac fingers of corrupt APC leaders and the cabal in the Presidency.
