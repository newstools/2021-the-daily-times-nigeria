By Idibia Gabriel A Kaduna State High Court sitting in Kaduna has vacated the order it made directing the Nigeria Correctional Service to release Zeenat, wife of Ibraheem ElZakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), for COVID-19 treatment. The presiding judge, Justice Gideon Kurada, had on January 26, ordered Zeenat’s release based on a medical report presented by her counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), before the court. Falana had presented Zeenat medical report, asking the court to allow his client to seek treatment outside the correctional centre in accordance with measures put in place by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). However, the court revoked the order after an oral application by H.G. Magashi from the chambers of Falana, who claimed that the defendant has regained her health.
