TUNDE SHORUNKE Due to the output cut agreement of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies aimed at stabilising the global oil market, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said it is focusing more on the gas, condensate and other revenue streams to tackle revenue challenges. The Corporation, therefore, reiterated its commitment to abide by the output cut agreement of the OPEC and its allies aimed at stabilising the global oil market. The Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated this Wednesday while speaking at the ongoing virtual Gulf Intelligence “Global” UAE Energy Forum 2021. Mallam Kyari noted that despite the negative effects of the production cut on government revenue, it was the best step towards redeeming the value of hydrocarbon resources at the global market in the interest of all.

He explained that gas proved to be a steady and reliable revenue stream during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, adding that gas production and utilisation would remain a key priority for the Corporation in 2021. Earlier in his presentation, the Minister of Energy & Agriculture, United Arab Emirates (UAE), H.E. Eng. Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei appealed to all oil-producing nations not to flood the market with crude oil. He said the UAE was at the moment more concerned about balancing the market forces of demand and supply in the global market than growing market share.
