The new U.S. administration of Joe Biden will most likely maintain its military presence in Syria and revert to Obama-era policies of arming and training rebel groups, an official said. The Syrian Arab Army, Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Abbas (rtd) said this on Thursday. “These incidents are likely to be the precursors of escalatory attacks in the region with the arrival of Joe Biden, who will adopt the policy of Obama. “This means that he will invest in additional terrorist elements and fighters from the region to fight for American interests,” Abbas said, commenting on the recent surge of terrorist attacks in Syria and Iraq.

This is the latest in a series of roadside ambushes perpetrated by terrorist elements in Syria throughout the course of the past month. “Biden will not leave Syria even though Trump had announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria,” the retired general added, highlighting the importance of the region to the U.S. Middle East policy. A similar surge in terrorist activity occured in neighbouring Iraq within the same time-frame last Thursday, with the country’s capital witnessing its first suicide bombing in years. Claimed by IS, the twin terrorist attack targeted Baghdad’s marketplace, killing 30 and injuring 100.
