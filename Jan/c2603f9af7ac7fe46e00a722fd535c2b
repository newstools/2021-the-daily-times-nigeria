Joy Obakeye A Magistrate Court in Ifo local government area of Ogun State, has sentenced a sixty year old man, Bakare Buraimoh, to six months imprisonment at the Ilaro Correctional Centre, Ogun State, for assaulting one Abiodun Fakoya, a staff of Ikeja Electric (IE) attached to its Olowora Undertaking Office. The judgement was delivered on December 30, 2020 against Buraimoh, a resident of Isheri-Olofin Community. In the judgment delivered by Magistrate A. I. Arogundade, the accused was found guilty of the offence and thereafter sentenced to six (6) months imprisonment with option of N100, 000 fine. While reacting to the judgement, the Head of Corporate Communications, Ikeja Electric, Felix Ofulue, said the decision to seek redress in court over attack on the staff of the company is to stem the menace as he hoped this will serve as a deterrent to other offenders against future reoccurrence.

Customers should make use of the appropriate channels to communicate their concerns to the Company,” Ofulue noted. “While the Company will seek legal intervention to address assault on its staff, it will also not condone any act of misconduct displayed by its staff. That is why we always emphasize and urge our customers to report improper conduct or illegality through the whistleblowing channels” he explained.
