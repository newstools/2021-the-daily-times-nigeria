Abdulkareem Mati, a 13-year-old child, was detained by the Kastina State police command for reportedly killing two bandits and fleeing the woodland where he was being held. According to the reports, the 13-year-old child was kidnapped from his parents by bandits, who informed him and his parents that he would be working for their boss in the bush. “His mission was to assist the bandits’ leader, Ardo Nashaware, in the breeding of cows in the Birnin Magaji forest in Zamfara State,” a source told our correspondents. When they arrived at Birnin Magaji woodland, it was discovered that things did not proceed as planned. Instead of the promised cows, they gave Abdulkareem an AK-47. According to the report, they began teaching him how to use the rifle and other weapons that had been supplied to him. He was also given the task of caring for their kidnapped captives. The 13-year-old child allegedly got away from the bandits after killing two of them for harassing him, and was later discovered and captured by the Katsina police command with the suspected AK-47 used in the murder. Gambo Isah, the Katsina State Police Public Relations Officer, corroborated the report when reached by phone. According to a police spokesman, the child showed proficiency with an AK-47 weapon and confessed to having been bullied by some old bandits who irritated him, prompting him to take up an AK-47 weapon and shoot two of the old criminals.
