In order to continue Continuous Voter Education next week, the Independent National Electoral Commission has created an online registration platform. In a news conference on Monday in Abuja, INEC Chairman Mahmood Yakubu revealed this. The Chairman noted that online registration will help to alleviate the hardship of lengthy lines during CVR in a statement released on Tuesday headlined “Continuous Voter Registration: Media experts, INEC agree to sensitize public.” He said, “In the next one week, Monday 28th June 2021, the Commission will resume the Continuous Voter Registration nationwide. “In doing so, the Commission is introducing a portal to enable eligible Nigerians to commence registration as voters online before completing the exercise physically at designated centres nationwide”. “This is the first time a major exercise of this nature is handled partially online, consistent with the Commission’s commitment to continue to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process in Nigeria “Just like the expansion of voter access to Polling Units, the Commission appeals to the media for support so that this novel idea will also be successful.” While speaking on the duration of the CVR, Yakubu stated that the exercise will last “for at least one year.” “The success of the exercise depends, to a considerable extent, on citizens’ awareness through voter education. There will be new registrants, requests for intra-state and inter-state transfers as well as the replacement of voters’ cards as provided by law,” he said.
