Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State was reportedly whisked away by his security guards after angry youths stormed his office to protest the gruesome murder of two of their friends. Members of the National Road Transport Workers (NURTW), otherwise known as Park Manager System (PMS) had on Wednesday clashed in the Iwo Road area of Ibadan and left two people dead. The Chairman of PMS, Mukaila Lamidi, popularly called Auxiliary was fingered as the mastermind of many clashes in the state. The angry youth stormed the secretariat in the evening with the corpses of the victims and those injured in the clash. According to SaharaReporters, Governor Makinde was still in his office around 5:48 pm when the angry youths arrived but he hurriedly exited through the fire service gate. A source in the governor’s office said; “We were still at the governor’s office at the time those protesters stormed the secretariat yesterday evening. The governor left the secretariat through the fire service gate. I guess he didn’t know how to pacify those people because they were angry.

Auxiliary and his thugs cannot change. “NURTW was silenced by Isiaka Ajimobi’s administration during his eight years in office. Did you hear they were on a rampage for eight years? No. I don’t know why Makinde is empowering this thug called Auxiliary. Did you see the video in which Auxiliary was threatening to kill the former governor of Ekiti state, Ayo Fayose? Is that a good man? Makinde could have followed some policies of Ajimobi, especially in the area of security to maintain peace in the state.”
