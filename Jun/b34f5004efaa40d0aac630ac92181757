The United States on Monday reiterated its readiness to hold talks on North Korea’s nuclear programme without any preconditions. “We continue to hope that North Korea will respond positively to our outreach and offer to meet anywhere, anytime without preconditions,’’ U.S. special envoy Sung Kim said. Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have not made progress since a failed summit in Vietnam in 2019. Since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, North Korea has appeared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Kim said last week his isolated country must be prepared for both dialogue and confrontation with the United States. Biden called Kim a “thug” last year before he took office in January but is pursuing what the White House calls a “calibrated, practical approach” that is open to diplomacy with the rogue regime.
