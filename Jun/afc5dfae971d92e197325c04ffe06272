President Muhammadu Buhari has submitted a formal request to the Senate for the confirmation of Major General Farouk Yahaya, the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff. On Tuesday, Senate President Ahmad Lawan read the request, which was contained in a letter. Buhari encouraged the Senate to act quickly in considering and approving his recommendations.
