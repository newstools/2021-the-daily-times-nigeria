ASP Sunday Abutu, the command’s spokesman, who made the confirmation to newsmen, said the detective was murdered during an argument with some soldiers. “I can confirm we heard that the DSS operative was killed during a hot argument with some soldiers yesterday, (Friday) evening. “The deceased corpse has been deposited in the morgue and I can assure you that the perpetrators of the murder have also been arrested. “Let me also add that our detectives have started investigation and we will get to the root of the matter,” Abutu said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the incident happened in Ado Ekiti on Friday evening as three soldiers allegedly killed DSS operative inside the hotel (names withheld). A reliable source told NAN that the incident occurred about 7.30 p.m. at the hotel located along NTA road in Ado Ekiti, where one of the soldiers allegedly stabbed the detective DSS on the neck. NAN gathered that the incident happened following the arrest of a suspected fraudster in the hostel. The source said “As the soldiers who were inside the hotel stopped the young man they suspected to be a ‘yahoo boy’ and started interrogating him, the young man saw the DSS operative on a bike and beckoned on him to come to his rescue. “When the DSS man got to the soldiers, a hot argument ensued between them and one of the soldiers became so angry that he drew out a knife and stabbed DSS operative in the neck. “The DSS man fell immediately and started bleeding. The people who are inside the hotel drinking began to run for dear lives. In fact they hurriedly fled the scene to prevent being arrested,” the source who pleaded anonymity said. The source also said that few minutes after the incident some DSS operatives stormed the hotel from nowhere and arrested the soldiers. NAN
