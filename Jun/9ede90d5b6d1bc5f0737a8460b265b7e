She made the announcement during a press conference at the Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lago State. The court had refused to approve Baba Ijesha’s bail application. Princess said that Baba Ijesha had raped a 14-year-old girl in her care.On April 22, 2021, the actor was apprehended by the police and has been in detention since. However, Ayeni insisted that the allegations were baseless because the girl in question claimed Baba Ijesha never slept with her. She said: “My name is Ewatomilola Ayeni and the person in question is my elder brother; I am a niece to Baba Ijesha. “If indeed Ijesha did what he was accused of his mother-in-law who is here won’t support him if he is guilty of the offence. “Everyone is shouting, ‘defilement’ but if they know what happened seven years ago – has Princess herself revealed the number of times she seduced Ijesha? Princess the popular comedienne you all know severally went naked before Ijesha and asked him to sleep with her. “Ijesha cannot fight but we will fight for him. “There were times that Princess called Ijesha to come over to her place, that she has prepared Ofada stew, knowing full well that he has a wife, even though she is not in Nigeria.”
