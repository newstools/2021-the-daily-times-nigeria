Barbora Krejcikova sealed the women’s doubles title at the French Open on Sunday, a day after her singles triumph. The 25-year-old Czech teamed up with compatriot Katerina Siniakova to prevail 6-4 6-2 over American Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Poland’s Iga Swiatek, last year’s singles champion. Krejcikova beat Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1 2-6 6-4 in the singles final on Saturday. She becomes the first female player in 21 years and seventh woman overall to win a singles and doubles title at Roland Garros. Krejcikova and Siniakova were also doubles champions in Paris in 2018 and also took the Wimbledon title three years ago.
