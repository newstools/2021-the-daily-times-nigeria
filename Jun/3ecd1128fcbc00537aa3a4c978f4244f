By Mutiat Alli Over the weekend Nigerian Idol contestants took us back to our roots. Contestants channeled their inner Fela as they paid tribute to the Afrobeat legend. The contestants opened the show with a joint performance of “Water No Get Enemy”. In preparation for the live show, the contestants paid a visit to the Kalakuta Museum and had the opportunity to meet Seun Kuti. The Big Bird helped the contestants interpret their songs and provided guidelines that helped with their performances. Comfort opened the single performances with her rendition of “Observation No Be Crime”. Her presentation was fantastic and was hailed by the judges. A testament to how much she has grown. Faith Jason followed up with a performance of “Palava”. The judges were impressed and gave him a standing ovation at the end of his performance. According to Seyi Shay, “I’m always happy when I see you. Every week you kill it. You haven’t failed me yet.” Francis Atela also received a standing ovation after he sang “Yellow Fever”. Obi Asika praised his synergy with the band. Another performance that wowed the judges was Kingdom’s version of “Gentleman”.
