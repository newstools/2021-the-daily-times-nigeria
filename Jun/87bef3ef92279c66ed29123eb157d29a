Idibia Gabriel,Kaduna The Minister of Youth and Sports Mr. Sunday Dare has been accused of the most corrupt, incompetent, and confused Minister of the time. World boxing champion, Bash Ali who made the accusation in a letter addressed to the sports Minister alleged that Sunday Dari extorted the sum of N13 million from him. In a letter, he personally signed and made available to our correspondent recently, Bash Ali threatened that he’ll shut down the ministry of sports if the minister failed to return the money with interest. The letter which he also sent copies to the President, Vice President Chief of staff, EFCC, ICPC among other relevant government agencies reads in parts:MINISTER SUNDAY DARE, YOU ARE THE MOST CORRUPT, INCOMPETENT & CONFUSED MINISTER OF ALL TIME. RETURN WITH INTEREST THE N13M YOU EXTORTED FROM ME WITHIN 14 DAYS OTHERWISE, I WILL SHUT DOWN YOUR MINISTRY. May 31, 2021Sunday Dare,Minister,Ministry of Youth and Sports,Abuja, Nigeria. Through: Permanent Secretary. “Sport is one of the biggest industries in the world and if well organized in Nigeria will earn big-time money for the government”. My Dear Brother, RE: GUINNESS WORLD RECORD BOXING CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT VERSUS CORRUPTION & BAD ADMINISTRATION IN NIGERIA. THE SABOTAGE OF NIGERIA’S ECONOMY. You are the most CORRUPT, most INCOMPETENT, and most CONFUSED minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of all time. I am once again respectfully asking you to refund with interest the N13M you extorted from me in the name of President Muhammadu Buhari, obey President Buhari’s October 15, 2019 directive, keep your November 4, 2019 PROMISE to me, apologies to me for the defamation of character and then resign your position because you are the WORST PUBLIC SERVANT, ever. Failure of you to do these within 14 days from the date of the receipt of this letter will result in me shutting down your ministry. This is not a THREAT but a PROMISE. I am the ONLY boxer in the world to win a world boxing championship without FIRST boxing as an amateur. I am the most qualified boxer to earn a place in the Guinness World Record (GWR) as the OLDEST to fight and win a world boxing title. No 2 is Evander Holyfield of the United States of America (USA). No 3 is Mike Tyson, USA and no 4 is Roy Jones Jr, USA. Simply put, I am the BEST BOXER in the world. In America, these American boxers are celebrated like Gods but unfortunately, I am a Nigerian in Nigeria, a country where CRIMINALS are celebrated and HEROES are relegated to the back burners. In 2006, I swore to the Almighty Allah that I will NEVER give any Nigerian official a KOBO to realize in Nigeria my ambition to set a GWR, and 15 years later, despite facing unlimited CORRUPTION and unprecedented level of BAD ADMINISTRATION, I have refused to compromise until you were successful in extorting N13M from me in the name of President Buhari. Despite the two inaugurations of the above Local Organizing Committee (LOC) on November 9, 2006 and January 7, 2014 by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN), despite this Project being the first Project approved by my no nonsense zero tolerance for CORRUPTION & BAD ADMINISTRATION President Buhari on assumption of office, despite letters from the FGN through your Ministry to the International Boxing Union that Nigeria is a safe country to host this historic event and that your Ministry will facilitate the quick release of the Fight money, despite a third inauguration (May 21, 2019) of the above LOC by the FGN, despite President Buhari’s October 15, 2019 directive to you to meet with me, despite meeting with me on November 4, 2019 where you begged me to settle out of Court the N28M awarded to me against former Minister Solomon Dalung so you can call for a meeting with the members of the above LOC to discuss how to successfully host in Nigeria the historic Fight, despite extorting N13M from me to settle out of Court, you now made a 360 degrees turn to say the FGN is not and has never been involved in the hosting of this historic event because I turned down your request to share with you and your cohorts 50/50 the Pay Per View Television (PPVTV) Revenue instead of the money going to the FGN. Sunday, how can you be the Minister of Youth and Sports and can’t generate a KOBO from Sport for the country? Instead, you prefer to go cap in hand to beg for money from the FGN to run your Ministry, and most of the time, you claim you don’t have enough money so some of the athletes can’t go for competition. You kill their dreams. You create more Boko Harams, more armed robbers, etc. And because of CORRUPTION & BAD ADMINISTRATION, you try to kill a historic event that will bring HONOUR, GLORY & FINANCIAL GROWTH to Nigeria. Tell Nigerians what event you have in Nigeria that will generate a KOBO for the FGN.Sunday, you are also the worst example for Youths to emulate because you are the most CORRUPT, most CONFUSED & most INCOMPETENT. It is a SHAME that you are in the cabinet of President Buhari but you do not share his vision for a better country. It is a SHAME. I have met and reported you to the following people in the FGN; Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, the Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, and the Executive Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai who, because of his love for a better Nigeria through sport, wrote to you a letter that was acknowledged in your Ministry on March 1, 2021, asking you to do the right thing by calling for a meeting with the members of the above LOC as PROMISED. Despite his intervention, you have refused to do the right thing unless you get your 50/50 PPVTV revenue demand. Sunday, SHAME on you!! What is wrong with Nigerians in power to help other Nigerians to excel? Why do you kill our dreams and blind our visions? Why? Many non-corrupt and patriotic Nigerians have been frustrated out of Nigeria to go abroad to realize their dreams. I am a Nigerian and I deserve to excel in Nigeria without giving you a BRIBE and I will die with you Sunday Dare, and go to hell before I give you a BRIBE or GIVE UP ON MY COUNTRY, NIGERIA. Mark my words. I repeat you are the most CORRUPT, most INCOMPETENT, and most CONFUSED minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of all time. I am once again respectfully asking you to refund with interest the N13M you extorted from me in the name of President Muhammadu Buhari, obey President Buhari’s October 15, 2019 directive, keep your November 4, 2019 PROMISE to me, apologies to me for the defamation of character and then resign your position because you are the WORST PUBLIC SERVANT, ever. Failure of you to do these within 14 days from the date of the receipt of this letter will result in me shutting down your ministry. This is not a THREAT but a PROMISE. I MUST break the JINX that you can’t succeed in Nigeria unless you give BRIBE to government officials. I MUST. Mark my words. Respectfully submitted for your urgent action within 14 days. Ma’Salam.
