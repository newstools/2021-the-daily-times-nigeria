He also stressed that the development played a significant role in his drive to succeed against the odds. “Surviving was hard. Bariga was not far from the other slums you see across the world, from Mumbai to New York and London – life in the ghetto is almost always the same everywhere,” he said. “There were days when being able to afford three square meals was a big deal for my family. All of that motivated me to hustle hard – I wanted to see the whole world and experience different cultures from what I grew up seeing.” He added that ‘Triumphant‘, a track off ‘Carpe Diem’, his 2020 album, was inspired by the need to change the narrative about people living in ghettos.
