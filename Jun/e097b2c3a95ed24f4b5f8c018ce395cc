Nigeria’s Super Falcons lost 0-2 to world champions U.S. in their last game at the four-nation tournament on Thursday at Austin in Texas, U.S. The match, played at the Q2 stadium, is the first-ever international friendly between both countries and the Falcons made efforts to absorb pressure from a high-flying U.S side. However, Manchester United’s Christian Press scored the hosts’ first goal in the additional minutes of the first half off an assist from Carli Lloyd. The introduction of Akudo Ogbonna, Charity Adule and Gift Monday in the second half was not enough to stop the world champions as they continued to pile on the pressure. Their efforts bore fruit as Press set up North Carolina Courage’s Lynn Williams for their second goal in the fourth minute of second half added time. “I am impressed by the professionalism of the players and their courage even when they were on the backfoot,” Falcons’ coach Randy Waldrum said at the end of the game. “They played very competitively against the best team in the world and I am extremely proud of them.” Nigeria had earlier lost by a lone goal to Jamaica and also secured a 3-3 draw against Portugal in the tournament.
