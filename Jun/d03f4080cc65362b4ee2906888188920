Lionel Messi scored a stunning free-kick, repeatedly dribbled through the Chilean defence, and created opportunities regularly for his Argentina team-mates. Despite Messi’s intense performance, Argentina was held 1-1 by Chile in its Copa America opener. The game at the Nilton Santos stadium in Rio de Janeiro was also marked by a tribute to Argentine football great Diego Maradona, who died in November at age 60. Messi, who turns 34 this month, might have one of his final chances of winning a title with Argentina at the Copa America. He said ahead of the opening game that winning with his national team is “the biggest dream” of his decorated career, despite all the individual success and club titles with Barcelona. Argentina appeared to be ready to start giving Messi what he craves. Coach Lionel Scaloni’s lineup wasted three clear opportunities between the 16th and 18th minutes, one from Lautaro Martínez and two for Nicolás González. But Chile transformed into a more attacking team in the second half and earned a penalty after video review. Arturo Vidal’s shot from the spot was stopped, but Eduardo Vargas nodded into the empty goal to level the scoring in the 57th. Messi continued to create opportunities until the end of the match, but his team-mates showed the same difficulty to deliver goals as they did in the 2-2 draw at Colombia in a World Cup qualifier in Barranquilla last week. “This match got complicated to us,” an exhausted Messi said after the draw. “We needed to be calm, have the control of the possession, and play more quickly. The penalty changed the match, too.” The superstar also complained about the apparently irregular pitch at the stadium.
