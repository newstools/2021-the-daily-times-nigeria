Governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform have stated that President Muhammadu will decide when the party’s proposed national convention will take place. Abubakar Bagudu, Chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), announced this at a late-night meeting of the forum in Abuja on Wednesday. Bagudu told reporters on Thursday that the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni, had briefed his colleagues and informed them that the president had received a proposal for a time-table/schedule of activities leading up to the convention. He noted that once Buhari gives approval, a date will be announced. “There is a proposal before Mr. President and once he approves it, the National Caretaker Committee will announce the date. “We considered the timetable and we have made some inputs particularly to comply with the Electoral Law and the party’s constitution. Remember, we governors are just one organ of the party,” Bagudu said.
