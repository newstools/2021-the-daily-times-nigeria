On Saturday, June 5, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, ordered the prosecution of Nigerians who defy the government’s Twitter ban, but did not specify which law is being broken. When asked which law the AGF planned to use to prosecute any violators, Umar Gwandu, the AGF’s spokesperson, informed Premium Times that “the suspected violators would find out in court.” “At the moment of prosecution, we will invite journalists, and they will be aware of the legislation that will be used to prosecute. The point is that Twitter is no longer available. Anyone should avoid attempting to use Twitter.
