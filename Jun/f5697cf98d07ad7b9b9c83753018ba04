Governor Bello Matawalle has raised the alarm over the increasing insecurity in Zamfara State. Matawalle said the insecurity in Zamfara State is worsening at an alarming rate, stressing that It was clear that some invincible hands are plotting evil against his people. The governor disclosed this at the weekend after confirming bandits attack on Kadawa village, Zurmi Local Government Area, in a special broadcast on Democracy Day at the weekend. He, however, prayed to Allah to reveal those who are perpetrating these cruel atrocities against his people, saying that the bandits killed “many innocent people.” “I feel saddened by this unfortunate and barbaric act of cowardice,” Matawalle said. “With a heavy heart, I convey my condolences on behalf of my family and the entire people of the State over this massacre. “In recent weeks, the act of banditry has reverted to the ugly dimensions it had prior to the coming of my administration. The marauders kill without regard for any rules of sanity. Women, the elderly, and children aren’t spared. “Unfortunately, things suddenly took a dramatic turn, and things are getting worse by the day. It’s clear that some invincible hands are plotting evil against our people with the goal of making our State as terrifying as it was in the years gone by. “My constant prayer is for Allah to reveal those who’re perpetrating these cruel atrocities against our people.” Recall that this is coming less than six days after bandits unleashed terror in Askawa and Gidan Dannunu communities in Zurmi Local Government Area of Zamfara State killing 30 villagers.
