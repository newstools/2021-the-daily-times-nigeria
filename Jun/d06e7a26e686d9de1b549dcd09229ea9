Inter Milan president Steven Zhang has vowed not to let Romelu Lukaku leave the club this summer. Lukaku, who grabbed a brace in Belgium’s 3-0 win over Russia in Euro 2020 on Saturday, has become a major transfer target for top clubs in Europe. However, Zhang says they’ll be counting on Lukaku next season. “Winning the Scudetto was an incredible feeling, we beat great opponents, including those who had won the title in the previous nine seasons. You can’t imagine what you feel when the city and the fans are so happy, especially at this moment,” Zhang told Sky Italia. “Every player is important, even those who are off the pitch. Lukaku is special, not only as a footballer but also as a man. He has a big heart and he is caring and polite to everybody. It’s rare to see someone with such a big heart. I remember that Conte insisted on signing him two years ago, and he was right to make us make this economic investment. He was the right player. “I don’t know if history will repeat itself, but millions of people will remember this moment.”
