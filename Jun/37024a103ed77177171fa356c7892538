By Mahbub Hasan Tutul Opposition party BNP has urged the government to allow its chairperson and former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia, to receive advanced treatment abroad, shunning “politics of vengeance”, as she is in a vulnerable state with various health complications. “Our chairperson is now seriously ill. As she couldn’t receive proper treatment over the last four years since she was in jail, she was affected with many diseases,” said party’s Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir. He said, “We urge the government to allow the great leader and three-time Prime Minister, who had struggled for a long time for democracy, made huge contributions to the development of the country, to receive advanced treatment shunning politics of vengeance.” Fakhrul made the call while inaugurating a tree-plantation programme in the capital’s Beraid area arranged by Dhaka North City unit of BNP. He said, Khaleda was admitted to Evercare Hospital after being infected with coronavirus and she has already beaten the virus with the blessings of Allah. The BNP leader said their party chief has been suffering from heart, kidney, and liver problems. “She also had an old problem of arthritis which is causing serious pain. With all these diseases she is very ill and doctors are saying she is in a very vulnerable condition.” He said, Khaleda’s family members had submitted an application to the government seeking permission to allow her to go abroad for treatment. “But the government didn’t allow her to go abroad due to political vengeance.” The BNP secretary general also demanded the government free her fully and called upon people to pray for the speedy recovery of Khaleda.
