Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of praising Fulani terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers. The IPOB leader stated this while reacting to the N110m ransom demanded by bandits responsible for the abduction of students of the Salihu Islamiyya School in Tagina Town of Rafi Local Government Area of Niger.

Kanu in his reaction wondered why the president would proscribe IPOB demanding justice while bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers are being pampered. He wrote, “Look at the handiwork of the same #Fulani people lecturing us all about insecurity and threatening genocide in the East. A @NGRPresident that pampers terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers from his #Fulani tribe but proscribes freedom fighters demanding justice and fair treatment.”
