Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, has explained why President Muhammadu Buhari did not hand over power to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo before leaving for London. President Buhari is presently in London for a routine medical check-up. While speaking on a television programme, Shehu said the president did not hand over to Osinbajo because he would be away for a few days. Adding that the president will carry on with his duties from where he is at the moment. “He will continue from wherever he is. The requirement of the law is that if the President is going to be absent in the country for 21 days and more, then that transmission is warranted. In this particular instance, it is not warranted,” he said. “It is a medical trip and there is absolutely no urgency, no emergency; the President is not in any sick condition. “It is a routine medical check-up; the President has undertaken this with a set of doctors that he has retained over many years.”
