The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denounced the Edo government’s demolition of property belonging to former Deputy Governor Pius Odubu. In a statement issued in Benin by the state Publicity Secretary, Chris Azebamwan, the APC revealed this. Other party members whose properties were demolished, according to Mr Azebamwan, included Julius Ihonvbere (a lawmaker representing APC-Owan) and Mike Itemuagbon, a sports enthusiast. “We remember that Governor Godwin Obaseki demolished a private property of an APC chieftain, Mr Tony Kabaka Adun, about the same time last year.

We warn against future actions in this guise because they are motivated by hate and political intolerance and are part of a larger conspiracy by the Peoples Democratic Party and its administration to tear apart the structure that binds Edo citizens and ultimately overheat the polity.”
