Senator Rochas Okorocha of Imo West claims that Nigeria’s President will be elected in 2023 from the Southeast. The country’s mood, according to Okorocha, was ripe for an Igbo president. According to DailyTimes, the former governor of Imo State made the remark while hosting a pressure party, the Ndi Igbo Good Governance Initiative, in Abuja yesterday (NGGI). He said it would be unfair to refuse the Igbos the presidency in 2023. “The country did the moral thing by supporting the Igbos in their bid for the next president. “The country’s climate has changed, and there is a lot of division,” he said. “We want someone who can be trusted by the North and the Yorubas, and who can help the less fortunate and poor,” he said.
