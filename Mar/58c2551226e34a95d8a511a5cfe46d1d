In Sunday’s Belgian First Division A match, Paul Onuachu scored both goals as Genk defeated Cercle Brugge 2-0. This season, the 26-year-old has been in superb form for the Blue and White, and he added to his tally against Yves Vanderhaeghe’s side. The lanky forward made his 27th league debut, and he helped the Blue and White keep their winning streak going.After receiving a fine assist from Theo Bongonda in the ninth minute, Onuachu put John van den Brom’s side ahead with a superb finish. After being set up by Bryan Heynen, Junya Ito doubled Genk’s lead in the 24th minute, firing his effort beyond goalkeeper Thomas Didillon’s grasp. Hannes van der Bruggen received a red card in the 39th minute after being cautioned earlier in the game, leaving Cercle Brugge with one man short. Both sides failed to find the back of the net in the second half as the Green and Black frustrated every effort from the Luminus Arena outfit to try and increase their lead, despite their numerical disadvantage. With the result, Genk are now on a three-game winning streak, having last tasted defeat against Beerschot on February 21. The Blue and White have moved to the third position on the First Division A table after gathering 49 points from 30 games. Onuachu featured for 65 minutes before making way for his compatriot Cyriel Dessers, while Ike Ugbo was on parade for Cercle Brugge for 65 minutes. The Super Eagles attacker teamed up with the Belgian club in the summer of 2019 from Danish side FC Midtjylland and has now scored 34 league goals in as many appearances. In the current campaign, the centre-forward has bagged 26 goals across all competitions, including 25 in the Belgian top-flight. Onuachu will hope to continue his impressive performances in front of goal when Genk take on Anderlecht in a Cup tie on March 14. The attacker will be expected to be part of Nigeria’s team for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against the Republic of Benin and Lesotho later this month.
