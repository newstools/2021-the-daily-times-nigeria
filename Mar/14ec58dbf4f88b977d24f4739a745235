Senator Rochas Okorocha, a former governor of Imo State, has expressed confidence that he will run for president in 2023 and win. Okorocha, who represents Imo West Senatorial District in the 9th Nigerian Senate, revealed this on Thursday in Abuja during a courtesy visit by a group of young people under the banner of ‘Forward with Anayo Rochas Okorocha (FOWARO 2023)’. He said that the country was going through its most difficult period as a result of the ongoing insecurity. His word, “I have contested for the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria three times. The first time l ran when l was very young; 20 years ago, and l ran on the platform of ANPP. Later l ran on the platform of the PDP where l came second and the last one APC in 2014. “So, l have been in the business of running for this office. This time, it will be the fourth attempt. I am hoping to be the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Every time l started, l got stopped at the primary level, but this time around when l do run, l must win the race.”
