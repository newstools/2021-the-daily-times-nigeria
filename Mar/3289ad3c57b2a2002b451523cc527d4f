Michelle Obama, the former first lady of the United States, will join eight other women in the National Women’s Hall of Fame, including former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, soccer legend Mia Hamm, and NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, who died last year. On Monday, the National Women’s Hall of Fame announced the members of its Class of 2021, which will be inducted on Oct. 2. Octavia Butler, who died in 2006, Rebecca Halstead, who served in the military for nearly three decades, poet Joy Harjo, artist Judy Chicago, and activist Emily Howland, who died in 1929 and taught formerly enslaved people how to read and write in refugee settlements where she worked during the American Civil War, are among the others on the list. “Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most influential and iconic women of the 21st century,” the National Women’s Hall of Fame website said. “The National Women’s Hall of Fame will celebrate the inclusion of these extraordinary women into the Hall at the biennial in-person induction ceremony on October 2, 2021.” The organization stated that it was closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation in New York state and that it would carefully plan the in-person portion of Induction Weekend to ensure that all attendees were safe. It was stated that ticket sales would not begin until April or May. It will broadcast a live virtual stream of the ceremony for free to the general public. The National Women’s Hall of Fame, based in Seneca Falls, New York, claims to be the country’s oldest membership organization dedicated to honoring and celebrating the accomplishments of notable American women.
