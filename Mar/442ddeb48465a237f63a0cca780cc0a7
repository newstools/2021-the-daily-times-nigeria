The Amalgamated Union of Foodstuffs and Cattle Dealers in Nigeria (AUFCDN) has agreed to pay N4.75 billion to Northern cattle and food dealers as the union suspends its North-South food blockade. Following a meeting with federal authorities, represented by Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello, AUFCDN President Muhammad Tahir made the announcement in Abuja. According to him, “All stakeholders and members of AUFCDN in our nationwide strike are glad we achieved what we wanted to achieve. Since Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello begged us on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria, we agreed to call off the nationwide strike today.” Mr. Tahir told the Nation that Aso Villa had agreed to protect its representatives, avoid multiple taxes, and stop security agents from intimidating them on the roads. Mr. Bello’s other requests, addressed to the government through Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, the President’s Chief of Staff, include the security of the union’s members and the right to withdraw its services from states in the event of an attack. In protest of the loss of lives and property in the area due to insecurity, the union launched an indefinite food blockade a few days ago.
