As a rapper trying to show more versatility and fitting into my own niche in the music industry. The EP represents a journey, untold stories, and the passion for being extraordinary” – Acebergtm Hailing from Lagos, Nigeria, Acebergtm grew up with exposure to a variety of different music genres and fell in love with hip-hop and rap, citing Wyclef Jean as one of his earliest inspirations. In tandem with music was his passion for writing and poetry, which led him to begin writing his own songs at age 15. He eventually entered the studio circuit, networking with different producers and fledgling artists such as Kel P, Phantom and Tempoe, WineXroll, JFred, Fredibeat, Oshobeats, Mcomms, Graydon. During those early years, he cut his teeth as both a rapper and a singer in the Nigerian music scene. Now ready to take on a global circuit, Acebergtm makes a strong debut with “Far From Home,” and we can’t wait to see what the future holds for him.
