The group alleged that “The present government led by President Muhammad Buhari has openly demonstrated his hatred of Benue people. Late President Shagari and Yar’Adua once ruled this country with fear of God, but the reverse is the case, in the case of Buhari whose concern is purely Fulani.“In view of this, the association is calling on the federal government to as a matter of urgency arrest the leadership of FUNAM for questioning, it the duty of any responsible government to protect its citizens, not be selective in terms of protection and should anything happen to our governor, the other side of the people will be seen, they stressed. The association also called on Yerima Shettima to order, to stop making incisive and provocative utterances that will bring disunity at the time every rational thinking person or government is looking for peace. “If he claims he is representing the youth of 19 northern states which Benue is inclusive, has he made any effort to restore peace in trouble spots in the north?, PROABI lamented. According to them”Nigeria as a country does not belong to a group of persons or tribe as claimed by Fulani people.
