The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has launched a new remote work visa that will allow workers from all over the world to work and live remotely in Dubai. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, the UAE’s Vice President/Prime Minister, announced the news on his Twitter account on Sunday. According to him, the decision was made after the coronavirus pandemic in Dubai led to widespread acceptance of the work-from-home policy. He also indicated that this new visa allows workers to live and work in Dubai regardless of where their employers are located. “During a cabinet meeting I chaired, we approved a new remote work Visa for those living or intending to live in the UAE. “This new work visa allows employees from all over the world to live and work remotely from the UAE even if their companies are based in another country. “We also approved a multiple-entry tourist visa for all nationalities to strengthen the UAE’s status as a global economic capital,” he said.
