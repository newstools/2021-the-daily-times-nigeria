Nantes shocked Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 at Parc des Princes on Sunday thanks to Moses Simon’s header. The Super Eagles winger was given his 19th league start of the season against the Parisians after scoring in his last game for Antoine Kombouare’s side against Reims. The forward put in a five-star performance in the game, helping the Canaries get back on track after a three-game losing streak. PSG dominated the first half of the game and were rewarded for their efforts in the 42nd minute when Julian Draxler scored the game’s first goal. Nantes came out firing in the second half, pushing for an equalizer, which came in the 59th minute when Randal Kolo Muani netted his effort. Simon then calmly tapped home the ball after a through pass from Muani in the 71st minute, which proved to be the game-winner. The Nigerian international only played for 84 minutes before being replaced by Kader Bamba, while Mali’s Charles Traore played the entire game. Abdou Diallo, a Senegalese centre-back, played the entire game but was unable to save Mauricio Pochettino’s side from defeat. Despite the win, the Canaries are still in the relegation zone, having gained 27 points from 29 games. Simon has now scored four goals and provided one assist in 24 league appearances this season for Kombouare’s men, amid other dazzling displays. The forward will hope to continue his impressive performances when his side takes on Lorient in their next league game on March 21. Simon has been with Nantes since the summer of 2019, initially on loan before the deal was made permanent in 2020. The forward will be expected to replicate his fine club form for Nigeria in their 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later this month. Simon has made more than 30 appearances for the three-time African champions since he made his debut in 2015.
