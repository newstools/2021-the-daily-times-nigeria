On Tuesday, the Kremlin stated that it had purposefully chosen not to reveal the name of the Russian-made vaccine that President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to receive later that day. “We are deliberately not saying which shot the president will get, noting that all three Russian (-made) vaccines are absolutely reliable and effective,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He said Putin, who announced his intention to get vaccinated a day earlier, would probably be vaccinated in the evening and would receive one of the three Russian-made shots. Peskov said Putin had already done a lot to promote Russian-made vaccines, the most famous of which is Sputnik V. Moscow has also given emergency approval to two other domestic vaccines, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac. Peskov said that Putin did not like the idea of being vaccinated on camera.
