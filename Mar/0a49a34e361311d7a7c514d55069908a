The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has again claimed it got wind of a fresh arms purchase scandal worth $2.5 billion in which officials of the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration were named. It said this is another ugly testament of the “stench of corruption oozing out from the Buhari Presidency and the APC, as a party”. The party stated that with the controversy surrounding the $1 billion earlier released for arms yet to be addressed, it is alarming that a fresh $3.5 billion (N1.3 trillion) meant for the purchase of weapons to secure the country under the Buhari administration could not be accounted for. The PDP said that “the exposed barefaced contract scam in the $2.5 billion scandals as well as the outright disappearance of the $1billion as earlier revealed by the NSA, show the level of corruption and unscrupulousness among APC leaders and their agents, who are stealing funds meant for arms while our citizens are daily marauded, pillaged and murdered by terrorists, bandits, and kidnappers. “In fact, the unending exposure of sleaze in the security architecture of the Buhari-led administration has further heightened apprehensions in the public space that the security situation has been turned into a huge racket for corrupt enrichment of sneaky APC leaders and the cabal in the Buhari Presidency. “It is more distressing that instead of standing on the side of the people to demand a clean-up of the system and recovery of the stolen funds, the APC, as a party, is rather desperate to justify acts of corruption, because its leaders and officials of its government are involved”. The party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, demanded that the Buhari Presidency should come clean and offer explanations on both the $2.5 billion and $1 billion. Furthermore, the PDP restated its call to the National Assembly to conduct a joint open inquest into the funds and other monies drawn purportedly for the security of the nation under President Muhammadu Buhari’s watch.
