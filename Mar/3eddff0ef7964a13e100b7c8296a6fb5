A multi-ethnic group under the aegis of Nigeria Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self Determination (NINAS) said it has begun legal procedures to dissolve the amalgamation of the country and pave way for the establishment of a sovereign Yoruba nation. The leader of the group, Prof. Banji Akintoye who appeared on AIT’s Current Affairs Program, Focus Nigeria said the Federal government has continuously ignored the yearnings of the people for restructuring, stressing that the situation has given rise to incessant insecurity and poverty across the country. The Yoruba leader also faulted Nigeria’s 1999 constitution, describing it as fraud.He said the Constitution was imposed on the Nigerian people and as such cannot guarantee the benefits of democracy to the people. Prof. Banji ‘s position is coming after the expiration of the group’s 90 day-ultimatum given to the federal government to constitute a committee on Sovereign National Conference for the review of the 1999 Constitution.
