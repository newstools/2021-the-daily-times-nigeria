Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, says he will not tolerate disloyalty in his second-term administration. The governor also said anyone found disloyal would be sanctioned accordingly. He made the declaration on Monday at the inauguration of four newly appointed commissioners held at the International Culture and Event Centre, Akure, the state capital. The newly inaugurated commissioners include, Donald Ojogo (for Ministry of Information); Charles Titiloye (Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice); Wale Akinterinwa (Ministry of Finance); and Olayiwola Raimi (Ministry of Works) . All the new commissioners- Ojogo, Titiloye and Akinterinwa -served in the cabinet of Akeredolu in the first term while Raimi served as an adviser. The governor said, “Public service is the highest form of calling. It is a great privilege to be considered worthy in an environment which prides itself on vast availability of talents. “It is treason to betray this sacred trust for any reason. Anyone invited to participate in the discharge of this onerous task must regard himself extremely lucky.

Our administration will discourage recklessness, disloyalty, and all acts which interrogate any claims to decency and propriety.” Akeredolu enjoined the new commissioners to continue from where they stopped, maintaining that his administration would continue to encourage all public officials to perform optimally. “Only those who are ready to serve indeed will be engaged. We shall be demanding extreme diligence. We will not condone mischief and all acts which mock decency. We will sanction disloyalty with dispatch,” the governor stressed.
