The Ever Provided was wedged across the canal for 400 meters (1,300 feet) before salvage crews dislodged her on Monday. It was unclear when the canal would be open to full traffic again. Suez is one of the busiest trading routes in the world, and businesses were forced to reroute ships, resulting in hundreds of ship delays. Disruption to global trade will not end with the refloating of the Ever Given. According to Lloyds List, there are currently more than 370 ships waiting to pass through the canal, including container vessels, tankers, and bulk carriers. Clearing that backlog is expected to take several days. Some ships have already left the region, preferring to take an alternative, longer route around the southern tip of Africa. They will be joined by other vessels travelling from East Asia to Europe â€“ whose operators have decided not to risk waiting for the canal to reopen. Inevitably, cargoes will be reaching their destination much later than planned, there may be congestion when they arrive in ports while future sailing schedules have been thrown into disarray. The cost of shipping goods to Europe is expected to rise as a result. Industry experts are warning that the knock-on effects on delicately balanced supply chains could be felt for months to come.
