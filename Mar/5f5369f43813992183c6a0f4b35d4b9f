AC Milan moved four points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan by beating Roma. After Roma’s Federico Fazio fouled Davide Calabria, Franck Kessie put Milan ahead from the penalty spot. However, after five minutes of the second half, Roma’s Jordan Veretout equalized with a fine finish from 18 yards. However, after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was substituted to cover a groin injury, Milan scored the game-winning goal through Ante Rebic’s turn shot after Alexis Saelemaekers’ pass. Milan will face Manchester United in the Europa League last 16 on March 11 and 18 in two-legged matches in which Ibrahimovic, who spent a season and a half at Old Trafford, could face his former side. Midway through the first half, the Swedish striker appeared to sustain a groin injury, but he was still able to play until the 58th minute and was heavily involved. Ibrahimovic, 39, has 14 Serie A goals this season and had several opportunities to add to that number, but a shot was tipped over, another was cleared off the field, a goal was disallowed, he backheeled a chance wide, and he also headed over. Second-place finisher Milan had gone four games without a win in all competitions and are chasing their first league title since 2010-11. Inter beat Genoa 3-0 at home earlier in the day, with goals from former Manchester United players Romelu Lukaku, Matteo Darmian, and Alexis Sanchez.
