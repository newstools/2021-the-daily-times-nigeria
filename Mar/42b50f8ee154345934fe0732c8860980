Manchester City’s hopes for a Quadruple this season continued as they cruised into the Champions League quarter-finals, winning 2-0 in the second leg of their last-16 tie against Borussia Monchengladbach and 4-0 on aggregate. Pep Guardiola’s side were dominant over both matches and it took just 12 minutes to add to their 2-0 aggregate lead from the first leg. Kevin De Bruyne powered home via the underside of the crossbar as City extended their advantage. Soon after, Gundogan added a fine curled finish around Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer, scoring his 15th goal of the season. Gladbach – who have now lost their last seven games in a row across all competitions, their worst losing run since losing eight in a row between September and November 1989 – had a few sights of goal, but nothing that ever truly troubled the Man City defence as they breezed into the last eight. They will now be in the hat for the Champions League quarter-final and semi-final draw on Friday, as their march towards the Istanbul final continues. Manchester City have become just the third team in Champions League history to keep seven consecutive clean sheets. Only Arsenal, who posted 10 straight clean sheets in the Champions League ending in April 2006, have bettered Man City’s mark. AC Milan also recorded seven shutouts in a row, ending in April 2005.
