Dr. Sani Abdullah Shinkafi, leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Zamfara State has accused APC leaders in the State of offering 56 million naira to bandits to refuse the release of Jangebe abducted girls. He said that their aim was to sabotage the peace effort of Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle. Shinkafi, who was the 2019 governorship candidate of APGA in Zamfara State, made the allegation during a press briefing. “I, therefore, challenge politicians from both the ruling and opposition parties to subject their telephone numbers to security checks since I am confident that the story that will come out of that process would be shocking,” he said. According to him, the security checks on the personal telephones of the selected politicians should be from 25th of February to the time when the girls were released.

He urged the youth not to allow themselves to be used as stooges for burning down Nigeria by some desperate and selfish politicians, advising them to focus more on building the nation. Shinkafi also called on the government to come up with an initiative that will help in empowering the youth by creating job opportunities for them.
