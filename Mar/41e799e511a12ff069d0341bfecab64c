Floyd Mayweather has hinted at his intention to work with the two-time unified world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua in his coming fight against Tyson Fury. The duo appears to have a strong bond after Mayweather was seen showing support for Joshua in his title fight against Pulev, with the British-born Nigerian boxer claiming that the former welterweight champion gave him some tips to ensure victory against the Bulgarian. In a podcast interview with Rob Moore, Mayweather revealed he was in regular contact with the champion and was thrilled at the prospect of they working together “I look forward to working with Anthony Joshua real soon, we communicate all the time, we talk all the time,” he said. He maintained that Joshua’s loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. in 2019 was instrumental to the Nigerian becoming better. “But I think with Anthony Joshua losing a fight, that helped him become stronger,” he also said. With both fighters having reached an agreement on a title unification fight on Monday, they are expected to earn £100 million ($139 million) each, with the purse split 50-50 for the first fight and 60-40 for the rematch in favour of the defending champion. Still speaking on the matchup, the 41-year old admitted it could go either way while showing respect for both fighters boxing prowess. “It’s a very intriguing match-up, you can never say what’s going to happen in the sport of boxing. Both guys are great competitors. Like I say, me and Anthony Joshua talk on the regular, so I look forward to working with Anthony Joshua.” While a date and venue are yet to be confirmed for the title fight, late June or early July looks highly likely for the opening showdown.
