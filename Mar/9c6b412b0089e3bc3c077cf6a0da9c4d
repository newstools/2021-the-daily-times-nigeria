Following an action-packed match, Spain and Greece share the points in their opening World Cup Qualifier. Spain dominated the ball in the first half, and Olmo came close to breaking the deadlock with a fierce strike that cannoned back into play off the bar. Shortly after, Morata latched onto Kokeâ€™s pass and fired the hosts into the lead. 11 minutes into the second half, Martinez gave away a penalty after sliding in late on Zeca, and Bakasetas made no mistake from the spot. Spain pushed for a winner, but Greece held firm for a hard-fought point. Spain will hope for a better result in their upcoming Group B match. They travel to face Georgia next time out. Greece, meanwhile, have a friendly against Honduras before returning for a World Cup Qualifier on matchday three against Georgia.
