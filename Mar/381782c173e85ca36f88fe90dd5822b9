China will increase services provided by contracted family doctors to issue long-term prescriptions to the elderly and people with disabilities, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. The NHC said that the primary-level medical organizations and family doctors should play their roles in preventing myopia among children. The commission has also vowed to help improve the ability of family doctors to diagnose and treat common and frequent illnesses, and their capability to identify and deal with infectious diseases. Primary-level medical workers will receive strengthened training on preventing and controlling chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, the NHC added. The country had set up nearly 430,000 teams of family doctors in 2020 who are responsible for offering medical services including disease prevention, treating common diseases, and offering rehabilitation therapy.
