Nigeria has been reported to the World Trade Organization by the European Union (WTO). Nigeria’s dairy policy was the topic of the complaint. Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organization, made the announcement during a visit to the Central Bank of Nigeria in Abuja on Tuesday (CBN). The European Union has complained to the WTO about Nigeria’s restrictions on milk and dairy products, according to Okonjo-Iweala. She stated that the WTO will investigate the complaint, but urged Nigerians to use the WTO’s trade remedy initiative to protect local industries. Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, reacted by saying that the process of bringing milk and dairy producers together has been ongoing for six years, with the milk and dairy producers taking the situation lightly. He claims that one of the producers has been in Nigeria for over 60 years and does not believe it is appropriate to participate in backward integration, preferring instead to import goods.
