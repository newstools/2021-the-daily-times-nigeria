Tyson Fury has launched a new verbal assault on Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder in his latest public interview.The WBC heavyweight champion has appeared in a strange mood in recent clips, acting dismissively of the potential AJ bout which – if the promoters are to be believed – is close to being signed.Fury has one belt while AJ has three – the winner will leave with all four However, Fury seemed on the better form while appearing on the MTK Global live stream for their latest fight night.He began his tirade against Joshua: “I could drink 14 pints of beer and still give AJ hiding, no problem “Everyone in the building knows more about this fight than I do actually.Apparently, it’s done, it’s signed, we’ve got a date, venue – news to me, I don’t know anything… “I’m looking for a challenge, I’ve been looking, searching the world for 13 years as a professional to find a man who can better me. I just can’t find him.“Even if I go on away soil and give all the odds away, they still can’t beat me… “I’m not training anymore. Until I get a date, then I go back into training camp.“I only need six/seven weeks anyway for these bums and that’s it. “I don’t need no big, great sparring partners for a methodical bodybuilding type of guy.“I just need the local binmen, firemen, and local strongmen.”Fury floored Wilder twice and stopped him in round seven of their rematch in February 2020 Regarding Wilder, Fury added: “I’m sure he’s got to make all these excuses up in his own mind because maybe one day he’ll have to fight me again.“When he does, I’ll absolutely destroy him even easier than I did this time.“This time wasn’t even a boxing match, wasn’t even a contest. He hit me about three times in seven rounds. “I’m gonna take him out in one/ two rounds, proper annihilate him.”
