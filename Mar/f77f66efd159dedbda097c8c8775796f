Now worth a whopping $6.6 billion, producer, rapper, and fashion mogul Kanye West is the richest African American in the United States, according to Forbes Magazine. Led by his popular Yeezy brand, which has partnered with adidas and Gap Inc., the brand is now worth between $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion by UBS Group AG. Ye’ has also amassed $122 million in cash and stock and $110 million from his music catalog. Last year at this time, West claimed that his net worth was more than $3 billion, which is more than billionaires such as Oprah Winfrey, but that report wasn’t accurate. Forbes reported that his net worth at the time was $1.3 billion, but to that, West said, “It’s not a billion. It’s $3.3 billion since no one at Forbes knows how to count.”
