Some Yoruba youths on Monday removed Nigerian flags and replaced them with Oduduwa Republic flags around Teslim Balogun Stadium, in Surulere, Lagos State. This was seen in a viral video shared on Instagram. Nigeria is facing many challenges, some bordering on insecurity in the South which have recently contributed to agitations for self-determination. The unabated killing and kidnapping of people in the South-West by suspected Fulani herdsmen and the Nigerian government’s failure to solve the problem have also caused tensions between the region and North.

The hoisting of Oduduwa flags by these youths might also be connected with what a Yoruba elder statesman, Prof. Banji Akintoye, recently said in an interview that “the remedy to the bondage we are in, the remedy to the enslavement we are suffering on our ancestral space is called self-determination.”
