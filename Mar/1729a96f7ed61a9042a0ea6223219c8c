After allegations that he pushed for government help for now-defunct supply chain financier Greensill Capital, Britain’s former prime minister David Cameron is being investigated by an independent oversight body. Cameron persuaded the government to expand the company’s access to COVID-19 loan programs, according to the Financial Times, months before the finance company collapsed. “The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists is investigating whether Mr David Cameron has engaged in unregistered consultant lobbying,” the body said in a statement on Thursday. It said it would not comment further while the investigation was ongoing. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had no knowledge that Cameron had lobbied Downing Street officials to help Greensill. His spokesman said last week that the finance ministry decided not to support a request made by the collapsed company for the loans after “due process”.
