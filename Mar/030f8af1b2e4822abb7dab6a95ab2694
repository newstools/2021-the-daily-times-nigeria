Netherlands began their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign with a surprise defeat by Turkey. The Dutch, runners up in 2010, fell behind when Burak Yilmaz’s deflected shot wrong-footed goalkeeper Tim Krul. Yilmaz then converted a penalty before Hakan Calhanoglu curled in a third. Memphis Depay saw a late spot-kick saved for the Dutch, who threatened to fight back via goals from Davy Klaassen and Luuk de Jong, but Yilmaz’s superb free-kick rounded off the scoring. It proved a difficult evening for the Netherlands who initially struggled to trouble Ugurcan Cakır in the Turkey goal. Matthijs de Ligt went close to scoring for the Dutch just before half-time but his header was cleared off the line. And while two goals in the space of two minutes, from substitutes Klaassen and De Jong, gave them a way back into the contest, they were second best for long periods.
