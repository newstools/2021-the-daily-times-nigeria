The virtual community was saturated at the weekend when the largest performing arts festival in Nigeria and West Africa, Lagos Theatre Festival (LTF), held its 8th virtual edition. With its theme: ‘RECKLESS ART’; an embodiment of an Out of Bounds movement and the belief that art should be created with reckless abandon and no limits, the festival was replete with inspiring and evocative art. The LTF, founded by the British Council in 2013 as part of its ambitions to foster exchange, collaboration, and strengthen relationships between Nigerian and British artists through the presentation of high quality Nigerian and British theatre, has so far, reached over 770 million people online so it came as no surprise to see some spectacular performances like Kininso Koncepts Productions’ ‘Cream Body’, The Giddy Round Theatre Company’s ‘This Little World: A Solo Performance of Shakespeare’s Richard II’, Maestro Theatre’s riveting production titled ‘Unbridled’ headline this year’s event.
