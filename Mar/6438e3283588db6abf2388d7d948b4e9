ABIODUN TAIWO, ABEOKUTA In spite of the mass movement of politicians into the All Progressives Congress (APC), a popular cleric in Ogun State, Prophet Sunday Dare Iyunade, has warned that the party may disintegrate if it fails to correct errors and fulfill campaign promises to Nigerians. Iyunade, the President of Pentecostal Sanctuary Bible Ministries with headquarters in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, insisted that for the APC to avert the looming crisis, it ought to do the will of the people, “otherwise, Nigerians may turn against the party,” and this, according to the cleric, might lead to the end of the party. The cleric spoke over the weekend at a press conference organized to herald the activities marking the 25th anniversary and 19th annual convention of the church. “During the APC campaign in 2015, they made pronouncements that they should be driven away with stoned if they fail to perform. I foresee that their words may come to pass,” the cleric said.
