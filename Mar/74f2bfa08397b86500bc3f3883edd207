By Igho Akeregha The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has conferred an award on Governor Yahaya Bello as a “Friend of the Church” in recognition of his stand on equity and fair treatment of Christians in Kogi State and his friendliness to the religion. The award was presented to the governor by the CAN National President, Reverend (Dr.) Samson Ayokunle during the official dedication of the Government House chapel which he laid the foundation in July 2019 after 28 years of the existence of the State Government House. The CAN president thanked the governor for his step to bring justice and inclusiveness adding that it was only leaders who have the spirit of God that could take the bold step to build a house for God Ayokunle urged the Federal and other State governments to emulate the Kogi State Governor’s approach in ensuring fairness and balance in the affairs of governance between every religious sect in the state, alluding that such steps have guaranteed peace in the state and for his government. He said, “In the atmosphere of justice and mutual respect prosperity would be guaranteed and the country brings a plural nation, it is our duty that while practicing democracy we apply native sense taking into cognizance our plurality.” READ ALSO: Christian Association Of Nigeria Begs FG To Take Over LAUTECH (PHOTO) Bello, represented by Deputy Governor Edward Onoja, in his address, noted that he could not understand the dynamics behind the previous administration’s refusal to build a befitting worship center for the Christians within the premises of the Government House noting that because of the plural nature of the state such action was wrong. He noted that it was quite surprising that those who belonged to a much more enlightened generation have decided to politicize issues of religion as such parochial thinking was antithetical to the stride of any generation or society to make any progress. Bello noted that when he took office, he saw the absence of a worship center for Christians as an error which his administration deliberately decided to correct hence the dedication of the Chapel was significant for his administration.
