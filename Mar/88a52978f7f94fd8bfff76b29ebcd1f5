The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has warned the general public to stop sending congratulatory messages to its Chairman, Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa following his appointment as the Agency head. This was made known by the Head, Media & Publicity of the Commission, Wilson Uwujaren in a press release that was made available to newsmen. The release reads, “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has observed the increasing number of messages published in the print media by groups and individuals, congratulating Mr. Abdulrasheed Bawa on his well-deserved appointment as the Executive Chairman of the Commission.” “While the open exhibition of affection and solidarity may be salutary in our cultural milieu, and indeed appreciated, it is, however, inauspicious at this point in time and gradually turning into a distraction.” “Mr. Bawa is assuming the leadership of the EFCC at a time of great challenge and he desires to hit the ground running.” “What he needs from well-wishers and indeed all Nigerians, is support and prayers, and more importantly, credible information that will further the work of the Commission.” “He, therefore, appeals to all his admirers and well-wishers who might have the intention of demonstrating their love and support for him through paid newspaper advertisement to desist and instead channel such resources to more worthy causes, such as making donations to Orphanages and Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, camps.”
