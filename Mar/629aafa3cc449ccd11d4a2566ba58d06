The schools were delisted following large-scale examination malpractices.”WAEC usually delists or suspends centers where examination rules are breached,” he said.He said: ”students who registered for WAEC in those centers, will now have to write it in other centers”.The commissioner further said that there are existing procedures put in place to punish all teachers involved in examination malpractices in the state.”All the principals of the affected 42 schools will be removed and further investigation carried out on the matter.“Whenever there is examination malpractice, the first thing we do is to remove the principals of the schools in question.“Some of them usually blame the invigilators but there is no way the principal and teachers will not know about it.Ityavyar also said the state government would do everything possible to discourage students and teachers from further engaging in examination malpractice.
