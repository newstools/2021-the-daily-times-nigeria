The Nigerian Army has denied recording any casualty in another ambush by Islamic State-aligned jihadists operating in Borno State which was reported to have left 15 soldiers dead. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, said that “the soldiers only had injuries, nobody was killed”. The Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) had on Thursday near Gudumbali on the fringes of Lake Chad attacked the Nigerian troop. The soldiers who were said to be moving in a convoy of vehicles reportedly came under attack from the insurgents and a source put the casualty figure at 15 soldiers and four civilian JTF. The 10-vehicle convoy of the military was said to be on its way to Gudumbali from Kukawa for a military operation against the insurgents when it was ambushed.
