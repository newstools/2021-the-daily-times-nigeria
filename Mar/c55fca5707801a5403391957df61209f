By Doosuur Iwambe No fewer than 20 million Nigerians have been targeted annually to be brought under health insurance nationwide over the course of ten years. National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Executive Secretary, Prof Mohammed Sambo, who disclosed this at a ceremony to mark the kick-off of enrollment of beneficiaries in Jigawa State noted that the BHCPF was part of the overall effort to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. A statement by Emmanuel Ononokpono, NHIS Head, Media and Public Relations, quoted Sambo as saying that through the program, the vulnerable population has affordable access to minimum health care. He said that the BHCPF which is provided for in section 11 of the National Health Act of 2014 guarantees the application of 1% of Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) for funding of primary health care. According to Sambo, the commencement of enrollment of beneficiaries under the BHCPF is a strong indication of the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to tenets of the next level agenda on health, noting that the implementation of the National Health Act, signed into law in 2014, only began under the watch of the current administration in 2019.
