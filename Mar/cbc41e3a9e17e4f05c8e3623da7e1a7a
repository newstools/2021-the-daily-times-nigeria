Barcelona’s impressive winning streak in the Spanish Primera Iberdrola continued with a 5-0 victory over Valencia on Sunday, thanks to Asisat Oshoala’s goal. Prior to the match, the Nigerian international had failed to score in her last four league appearances for Barcelona, dating back to a brace in a 4-1 win over Real Madrid on January 31. In a 5-0 win over Fortuna Hjorring in the Champions League Round of 16 earlier this week, she ended a 266-minute goal drought in the Catalans’ colors. Alexia Putellas gave the hosts the lead from the penalty spot after just seven minutes on Sunday, as they looked for their 19th victory of the season. In the 25th minute, Aitana Bonmati set up Caroline Graham Hansen to double Barcelona’s advantage, and three minutes later, Lieke Martens supported Oshoala to end her league drought. Two minutes from half-time, Patri Guijarro grabbed a fourth of the match to put Barcelona far ahead against their struggling visitors. After the break, the visitors managed to hold on strongly to avoid conceding another, but could not stop the fifth courtesy of Hansen’s second thanks to Melanie Serrano assist one minute from full-time. So far this season, the Super Falcons captain has scored 18 goals in 27 matches across all competitions, which include 14 league goals, and played the duration of an encounter for the sixth time. After finding her goalscoring boots on Sunday, Oshoala will aim to build on her recent good form and help Barcelona maintain their superb winning run against Rayo Vallecano on March 20. Lluis Cortes’ side enjoys a nine-point lead on the Spanish top-flight table with 57 points after 19 games, with two games in hand.
