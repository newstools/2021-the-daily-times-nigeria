In Sunday’s Belgian Cup tie, Paul Onuachu scored his 27th goal of the season to help Genk defeat Anderlecht 2-1. This season, the centre-forward has been in blistering form for the Blue and White, and he added to his tally against the Purple and White. This was the Nigerian international’s 31st appearance in all competitions this season, and he helped his team continue their winning ways. After receiving a timely assist from Daniel Munoz, Onuachu scored in the 17th minute of the match with a fine finish. In the 34th minute, the 26-year-old centre-forward came close to doubling his team’s advantage, but his shot went wide. Just before the hour mark, Matt Miazga put the ball into his own net to help John van den Brom’s side extend their lead. After Jhon Lucumi was sent off for serious foul play in the 71st minute, Genk were reduced to ten players, and Anderlecht took advantage of their numerical advantage to cut the deficit in half through Adrien Trebel. Onuachu has now scored two goals in the Cup competition for the Luminus Arena outfit. The centre-forward will be expected to continue his eye-catching displays when Genk take on Standard Liege in their next league game on March 19. Onuachu teamed up with the Blue and White in the summer of 2019 from Danish club Midtjylland and has been delivering impressive performances. Genk are currently third on the Belgian First Division A table and the Super Eagles forward will hope to help his side finish the season on a high. Onuachu was recently omitted from Nigeria’s 24-man squad that will take on the Republic of Benin and Lesotho in the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later this month. The in-form attacker was named in the Super Eagles standby list to the surprise of many fans, who took to social media to express their displeasure on the decision by Gernot Rohr. The 26-year-old has, however, struggled to make an impact with the three-time African champions, having only scored one goal since his debut in 2019.
