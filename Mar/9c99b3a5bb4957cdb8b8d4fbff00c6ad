John Obi Mikel has declared Real Madrid attacker Eden Hazard the “worst trainer” he encountered at Chelsea. Hazard is currently battling to overcome a new injury setback at Real. And Obi Mikel told the Athletic: “I’ve always said that Hazard is one of the most gifted players, he had it all: speed, power, skill, technique … He was right behind Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. But only if he wanted to. He sometimes said, ‘Yes. I want to be so good, I can be. Not as good as Messi because he is from another planet, but I think I can be close to Cristiano and even better’. “Those were the words that came out of his mouth, but he is not that dedicated. He doesn’t train well, he’s the worst training player I’ve ever played with. “Why is he so bad? My God. Eden, Eden, Eden … ahhhh. Because he was so good that nobody said anything. He would arrive on Saturday and win the game for us, he was the man of the match. But on Monday and on Tuesday, he was in training and it was like he wasn’t there. Standing, wandering. Everybody fighting, screaming in the games and he didn’t do any of that. “But you saw him on the pitch, how good he was. .. It’s not fair that some people are so talented!”
