Tukur Buratai, former Chief of Army Staff has denied diverting funds meant for procurement of arms while in office. The National Security Adviser, NSA, Babagana Monguno, had said the newly appointed Service Chiefs did not meet the funds approved for the procurement of arms upon their resumption of office. However, Monguno countered the report, saying he was misquoted. Buratai has now said those with questions should channel their queries to the Ministry of Defence for details on how funds meant for arms were spent. He made the clarification, in a statement signed by his lawyer, Osuagwu Ugochukwu. The statement reads: “My attention has been drawn to an interview granted BBC by National Security Adviser (NSA), RTD Major General Babagana Monguno, wherein he was alleged to have accused former service chiefs of filtering ARMS Fund away. “I can confirm that Lt. General Buratai and other ex-service chiefs were never mentioned in the interview and neither was any arms fund missing under the stewardship of Lt. Gen T.Y. Buratai. “Interestingly, NSA Babagana Monguno has denied making such accusations. We, therefore, urge members of the public to discountenance any such misquoted narrative suggesting sleaze on the integrity of Rtd Lt Gen T.Y. Buratai. “Anyone interested in knowing how arms were procured by the ex-service chiefs and particularly Lt Gen T.Y. Buratai should channel such request for information to the Ministry of Defence.”
