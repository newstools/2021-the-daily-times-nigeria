By Mutiat Alli The CEO of KD Records, Kristen Dawodu has given an insight into the special bond that exists among the executives and artists of his record label. “We work together as a team. Once in a while, we sit together and discuss how we can move our music/ record forward,” he disclosed. “Most record labels don’t do this.” Although there are just two artists signed on KD Records label; Specdo and Deedee Jojo, Kristen Dawodu avowed that he has no intention of signing a new act at the moment. “For now, no additions. I just want to focus on my two artists. I want to push them as much as I can,” he said. On why he hasn’t signed a female act on KD Records, he said: “I guess I haven’t found the right one. A record label is not so much about signing artistes as it is a matter of having the wherewithal, the clout to push them further.” Prompted on the qualities he looks for in a talent he counts worthy of being an artiste of the KD Records’ family, Kristen Dawodu clearly stated, “Young, musical and mentally sound. Must be able to kill any beat for freestyles.” READ ALSO: FG opens bids for 12 federal highways Speaking further, he added: “I try my best to ensure my artiste is comfortable, that we are on good talking terms and that mutual respect exists between us.” He elaborated further on how KD Records avoids the artiste-label crisis that is endemic in the music industry: “I just don’t jump into signing and working with people just like that. First of all, before I sign any artiste, I will do background checks to know if he or she is someone who’s going to give me hard times.”
