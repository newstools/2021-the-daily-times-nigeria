Chad was disqualified from qualification for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations on Monday, according to the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The move by the Cairo-based organization comes after the Chadian national football federation was mysteriously dissolved by the country’s sports ministry. Chad was already at the bottom of Group A qualification. Namibia and Mali, who were scheduled to play Chad this week in the final two matchdays before the tournament in Cameroon in January, have both been awarded three points with 3 goals. Mali has already qualified for the 24-nation finals, while Guinea is two points ahead of Namibia in the race for the remaining spot. Guinea hosts Mali in Conakry on Wednesday, and a win will guarantee a top-two finish, while a draw will keep Namibia’s hopes alive. Chad’s suspension will have no bearing on Africa’s 2022 World Cup qualification, as they have already been eliminated.
