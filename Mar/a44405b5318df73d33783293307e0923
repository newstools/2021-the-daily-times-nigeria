Facebook Inc said in a blog post on Wednesday that it would lift its temporary ban on political advertisements in the United States on Thursday. The social media giant imposed a months-long ban on political, electoral, and social advertising as part of an attempt to combat disinformation and violations in the run-up to the Nov. 3 elections. Facebook briefly lifted its ad pause in Georgia for the state’s runoff elections in January, but then reinstated it. Following the Jan. 6 siege at the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump, Alphabet Inc’s Google restored its own political ad ban, which it had lifted in December. The ban was lifted by Google last week. Such bans, according to Democratic and Republican digital strategists, were too vague and failed to address the problem of organic disinformation on social media platforms. Earlier on Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) released a statement condemning Facebook for failing to commit to a firm deadline for lifting the ban, claiming that the freeze had made it more difficult for campaigns and groups to meet voters.
