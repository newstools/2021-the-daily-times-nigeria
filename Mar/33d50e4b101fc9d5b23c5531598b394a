The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has claimed that many Muslims of Igbo extraction have fled their homes to safer places after receiving death threats from fellow Igbos for daring to convert to Islam. According to MURIC, several mosques located in the South East have also been burnt down because of hate speech. The group said this while calling on authors of hate speech and fake news to “rewind, soften up and show remorse.” MURIC urged the government to begin deradicalisation of hate speech and fake news in order to douse tension in the country. It said that if not brought under control and urgently too, the crisis caused by fake news and hate speech may result in nationwide pogrom. MURIC fingered prominent pastors and opposition politicians among those behind hate speech.
