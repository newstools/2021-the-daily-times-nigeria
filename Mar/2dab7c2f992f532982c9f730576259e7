Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa says the landslide victory recorded by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the just concluded local government election has shown the supremacy of the party in the state and translates to an overwhelming vote of confidence in his administration. Governor Okowa made this assertion at cenotaph Asaba during the swearing-in ceremony of the 25 newly elected local government chairmen commended the state independent electoral commission ( disec) for a hitch-free election and Deltans for their turnout and peaceful conduct at the polls.Governor Okowa admonished the new council chairmen to always bear in mind that the local government councils are the vehicles through which government reaches the grassroots hence any weakness on your governance will be a disservice to the people and will impact negatively on the state government. For the first-timers, Governor Okowa charged them to build on the foundation laid by their predecessors noting that abandoning projects are unhelpful and counterproductive and to have peace and security, and prosperity for Deltans as their cardinal agenda. He further charged them to be resourceful and come up with creative ways to increase their revenue and to live among the people so as to gain their trust and respect The new chairmen were further charged to carry along other council executives their vice-chairmen and councillors in their day to day administrations It would be recalled that the ruling party in Delta State was declared the winner of all the 25 chairmanship seats and the 500 councilorship slots in the Saturday election by the state electoral commission.
