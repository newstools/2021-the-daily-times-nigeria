The convoy of Alhaji Zubairu Jibril Mai Gwari II, the Emir of Birnin Gwari, was targeted by armed bandits. The monarch’s convoy was attacked on the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway on its way to Kaduna on Tuesday evening, according to our reporters. According to a witness, the Emir was not in any of the vehicles involved in the attack. The Emir’s driver, Umar Jibril, confirmed the incident to Dailytimes, saying the 73-year-old monarch was elsewhere at the time. He told the Dailytimes that the bandits appeared in front of the vehicles in transit weapons and threw tree branches on the road to compel them to stop. “We did not stop, they targeted me, since I was driving but as Allah will have it, the bullet missed my head.” No one was hurt, he said, except for minor injuries from broken glasses. Birnin Gwari is one of Kaduna State’s Local Government Areas with a high level of attacks.
