Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is pressuring banks to introduce digital payment systems as hyperinflation causes persistent cash shortages in the bolivar currency. Maduro has targeted the public transit system – where roughly three-quarters of all circulating cash is spent – as the first stage of a plan he calls “the digital bolivar.” In January, he asked banks to deliver point-of-sale terminals to the Caracas subway system and bus drivers, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. With annual inflation hitting 2,665%, long lines form many mornings outside banks in Caracas as residents seek to withdraw a maximum of 400,000 bolivars – the equivalent of 20 U.S. cents – just to pay round trip transit fare to get to work. Venezuelans have stopped using cash bolivars for food and many other day-to-day purchases. It would take forty bills of 50,000 bolivars to buy 1 kilo (2.2 lb) of rice. Instead, many use U.S. dollars in cash or debit cards – sometimes backed by U.S.-dollar accounts at local banks. But many poor do not have bank accounts and services like public transit cannot process digital payments. In a sign of worsening cash shortages, the central bank on March 5 announced it would begin to issue bills worth 1 million bolivars each. Even that would be worth just a handful of rides. “Paying transport fares is complicated because there is no cash,” said Marina Ospino, a part-time salesperson and mother of two, as she rode a bus. “And to run an errand, you need to have a fortune.”
