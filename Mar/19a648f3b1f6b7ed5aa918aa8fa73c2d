During the lockdown, I was in Calabar when his fellow housemate, Lucy, was evicted and we had a reception for her alongside my carnival team. I try to encourage the next generation so that we can have a better Nigeria and this is one of the reasons I decided to host Laycon when Azuka approached me. Laycon went to the house and made a great impression on millions of Nigeria and I thought it was important we host him here at the Echoes of Calabar.” READ ALSO: How my styling did magic on Phyno’s song ‘ Highway’ – Kenepisode1 speaks The evening saw Laycon thrill guests with some of the songs from his EP which includes ‘Fall on me’, Wagwan and God Level’.
