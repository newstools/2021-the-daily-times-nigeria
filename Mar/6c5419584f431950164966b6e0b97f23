President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, and a number of governors are among the dignitaries expected to arrive in Imo State this week to commemorate Governor Hope Uzodinma’s one-year anniversary in office. Although Buhari will commission some of the governor’s main projects on Tuesday, the anniversary celebrations will kick off today, March 14, 2021, with an Interdenominational Service at Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri. The leaders of the National Assembly, party chieftains, and influential Imo people are expected to attend the week-long event, in addition to Buhari and Osinbajo. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Hon Declan Emelumba, said in a statement in Owerri that the governor will make a special broadcast to the citizens of the state outlining his sectoral achievements over the last year.
