A one-week Youth Summit has opened in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital with the State government announcing plans to spend about Three billion Naira in what it calls #EndSars Youth Empowerment scheme. Governor Dave Umahi disclosed this while performing the flag-off ceremony of the #EndSARS Youth Summit. Selected youths drawn from the thirteen Local Government Areas of the state are participating in the summit scheduled to last till March 10. The Governor explains that the youth empowerment scheme will see not less than three thousand youths in the state who applied and qualified for the program, receive substantial capital to set up their business projects, and become self-reliant. Governor Umahi insists that his administration has fared well in the area of human capital development, contrary to impressions in some quarters. The Ebonyi State #EndSARS Youth summit is a fallout of the anti-police, anti-bad governance protests by Nigerian youths that swept across the country in late 2020 year. Participants at the summit say, they look forward to a robust engagement.
