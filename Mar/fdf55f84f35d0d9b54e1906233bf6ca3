Babajide Sanwoolu, the Governor of Lagos State, has introduced a body camera system for law enforcement officers in the state. The officers will be trained on how to use the camera, according to the governor, who announced it on Wednesday. The Law Enforcement Technology Institute will provide them with training (LETI). The body cameras would document all of the security agents’ activities while on duty. The camera can be seen from the control rooms as well.
