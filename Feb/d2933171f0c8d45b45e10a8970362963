After the Super Eagles striker was shown a yellow card in the contest on Thursday, Leicester City will be without Kelechi Iheanacho for the return fixture of their Uefa Europa League Round of 32 clashes with Slavia Prague. Iheanacho got a yellow card in the 64th minute just after replacing Jamie Vardy in their goalless draw in Prague, which accrued his bookings to three yellow cards this campaign and he would therefore serve a one-game suspension. With three goals to his name after seven matches, the Super Eagles forward have been impressive in the Europa League so far, and his absence may be a worry for the Foxes who are looking for a win at next Thursday’s King Power Stadium against Slavia Prague. Also in the encounter, Nigeria midfield dynamo Wilfred Ndidi also received a yellow card, but Brendan Rodgers ruled the booking delivered to the Super Eagles duo and summed up the officer as “very bad”. “I don’t comment so much on them because I know it’s a very difficult job. But some of the decisions… I think we had Wilf [Ndidi] booked and Kelechi [Iheanacho] for the use of the elbow and it was clear it wasn’t. They were challenging for the ball, especially Wilf. “And then there were a few decisions, particularly on Cengo [Under] towards the end, where we were clearly fouled and didn’t get it. I didn’t think it was a very good night for them to be honest.” When Leicester City travel to Aston Villa for their next Premier League match on Sunday, Ndidi and Iheanacho are expected to play a role. In the league table, the Foxes are third, standing at 46 points with Manchester United second after 24 outings.
