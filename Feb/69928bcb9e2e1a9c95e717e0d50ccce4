Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has disclosed that the State pays N100,00 as compensation to herdsmen whose cows are killed during misunderstandings. He said the same compensations also go to farmers whose farms are destroyed by the herders. The Governor stated this when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television’s Sunrise daily on Wednesday, “We pay compensation of N100,000 for any cow that is killed on account of a misunderstanding between the farmers and the herders and pay the same amount for farmlands destroyed by strayed cows,” Governor Ikpeazu said. “We are not diagnosing the problem properly… we have people who are interested in creating anarchy,” he said. Recall that Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, had recently shared the news of his security outfit, Eastern Security Network, ESN’s invasion of the camp of the herdsmen in Isiukwuato, Abia State. In a video shared by the IPOB leader, the ESN operatives were seen burning houses and cows allegedly belonging to the Fulani herdsmen. They also killed some cows.
