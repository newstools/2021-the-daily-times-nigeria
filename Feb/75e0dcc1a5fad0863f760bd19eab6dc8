To reach the Australian Open final and end the American’s new hunt for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, Naomi Osaka claimed an impressive victory over Serena Williams. Osaka, the three-time Slam champion, withstood Williams’ early pressure to win 6-3 6-4. Osaka is on an undefeated run of 20 matches and has never missed a Slam final. The Japanese will face Jennifer Brady after the American beat Karolina Muchova in Saturday’s final. In her first Grand Slam final, Brady came past the Czech 6-4 3-6 6-4 to seal a spot. It will be a semi-final replay of the 2020 US Open, which Osaka went through in three sets. “I was really nervous and scared in the beginning and then I sort of eased my way into it,” Osaka said of her match with Williams. “It’s just always an honor to play her and I just didn’t want to go out really a dud. I just wanted to try my best.” It is the first time that Williams has lost a semi-final in eight appearances in the last four at the Australian Open. Williams would be left to rue the chances she let slip and wonder once again whether she will be equal to the big record of Margaret Court.
