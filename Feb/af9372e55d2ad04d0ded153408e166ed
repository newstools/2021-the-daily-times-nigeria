Femi Fani-Kayode condemns the attempt to ambush and abduct Sunday Igoho by Security Agencies. In a tweet, he said It is not only reckless but also very dangerous. If the security agencies want to see him all they need to do is to invite him to their office.

I just spoke to my brother Sunday Igboho. He told me there was a violent attempt to arrest him this afternoon by a joint team of soldiers, DSS operatives & policemen numbering about 40 on the Ibadan/Lagos Expressway whilst he was on his way to see Baba Ayo Adebanjo in Lagos. 1/ pic.twitter.com/tjyuKH58Bv Let me also send a warning to the FG that Sunday Igboho is a hero to millions of Yorubas & either killing him or detaining him unlawfully would be the biggest mistake they could make. Building bridges,dialogue& peace is better than violence & war.A word is enough for the wise.
