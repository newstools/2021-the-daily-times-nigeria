By Mutiat Alli As the issue of drug abuse among the youth continues to generate reactions across the divide, Nigerian music star, and songwriter, Daniel Damilola otherwise known as Nejo is his new single. What’s Cool, admonished the youth to live a drug-free life and embrace the positive side of life. The London-based singer who has a number of popular songs to his credit recalled his growing up days as he watched his father abuse alcohol and smoke, saying his new song and video reminded him of his young days when he could have fallen under the influence of drug abuse but he chose to ignore social vices. RainyMilli further explained that he was worried by the increase in the number of youths abusing drugs and other dangerous life-threatening substances, adding that with the situation now assuming a disturbing dimension, he could not have chosen a better time to release a song that discourages young minds against the abuse of drugs.

The singer maintained that what players in the music industry now see as ‘norm’ and ‘cool’ appears to be having a negative effect on the youth, who in return are emboldened and could go to any length to get ‘high’.
