Senator Abaribe is one of those citizens who speaks out without fear or favor. He agreed to speak explicitly to Garba Shehu while speaking today as he was being questioned on Channels Television, after he reportedly claimed that Enyinnaya Abaribe stood for the chief of the Indigenous People of Biafra, MaziNnamdi Kanu, whom he considered as a thief. He made it plain, according to the senator born in Abia State, that he needs to teach Garba Shehu as to what he meant. He made it clear to him that a judge said a senator was expected to stand for Nnamdi Kanu as a shortie and he(Abaribe) did. Then he was assaulted by the military and tried to run, and Garba Shehu turned around and named him a thief.

Nnamdi Kanu never bore any AK-47s or threatened people, according to him. He made it clear that Nnamdi Kanu was just holding flags and calling for a new republic. On many occasions, Senator Abaribe has shown that he is a courageous and articulate guy who is never ashamed to speak out, and that is why many Nigerians love him.
