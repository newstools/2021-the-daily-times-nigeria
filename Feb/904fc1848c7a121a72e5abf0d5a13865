The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has called for peace among all ethnic, tribal and religious groups in Nigeria. Tinubu made the call on Friday, during the Eighth-Day Fidau Prayer for the late Alhaji Lateef Jakande, the first Civilian Governor of Lagos State. He said that the country was facing a crisis but all needed to live in harmony and give peace a chance. ”Nigeria is currently facing a crisis; a crisis of insurgency, banditry in all aspects of security, but God Almighty that made this country as one of the largest and most resourceful country will protect us. ”I appeal, in his memory today, for us not to turn whatever challenges we are facing right now into ethnic, tribal and religion crises. ”If there is a crisis, where do we go? We will submerge the entire West Africa, there will be no enough space to accommodate us. ”Those who have seen the effect of war, the effect of tribal conflict, of religion conflict, will never want it for Nigeria. “We pray to God to strengthen our mind, guide our faith, put peace and bring peace unto this land, may Allah bless all of us,” Tinubu said.
