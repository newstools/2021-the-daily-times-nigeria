By Tom Garba, Yola The North-East Assistant Commander General of Hunters Group of Nigeria, ACG Haruna Umaru Furo, has commended the National Assembly (NASS) for pushing a bill to give legal tooth to the group and its operations as part of the country’s overall efforts to combat crime and criminality. According to him, hunters had the capacity to boost the fight against crime and all forms of banditry in the country by lending about 50 percent manpower to the security agencies. Haruna passionately appealed to the general public to support the bill that would soon be passed for its second reading in the National Assembly before being pushed for public hearing.
