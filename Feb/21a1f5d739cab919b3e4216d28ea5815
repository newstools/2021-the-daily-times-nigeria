ANDREW OROLUA, ABUJA. Justice Taiwo Taiwo on Monday ordered the Nigeria Police to produce former Governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim, and one Chinedu Oprareke in court on March 3, for arraignment. The order followed the absence of Ikedi Ohakim and Chinedu Oprareke in Court on Monday that aborted their arraignment by the Police before the Court. Justice Taiwo noted that the matter was for the arraignment of the defendants. He said the court will not overlook the absence of the accused persons because the prosecution has to produce the defendants in court.Defendants must be produced in Court at the next adjourned date for arraignment and possible trial. When the matter was called on Monday, Stanley Nwodo announced an appearance for prosecution but Chief Emeka Etiaba (SAN) who appeared for Ohakim questioned his capacity and authority to prosecute the case. To clear the doubt expressed by Etiaba the prosecution counsel Nwodo therefore properly introduced himself as Chief Superintend of Police. Nwodo said he was surprised that the defendants who are on administrative bail failed to honor the invitation to appear for arraignment. However, the judge observed that there was no proof of service of the hearing notice on the defendants in the court record.“They were not served with hearing notice,” he ruled.Justice Taiwo, further noted that since the 2nd defendant counsel chief Etiaba was in Court he should undertake to produce Ohakim in Court on the next adjourned date, and the counsel obliged to do so. Ohakim, who served as Imo Governor between 2007 and 2011, was alleged to have lied that the Amuchienwa threatened him with a gun, and equally made a false claim that he had a plot of land for sale in Lagos State.
