By Ben Alaiya Anglo-Nigerian world heavyweight boxing champion, Anthony Olaseeni Joshua, has said he would rather die in the ring and go to heaven than chicken out when he takes on World Boxing Council (WBC), champion, Tyson Fury. He said on his twitter page that all the talks being credited to Fury, were mere mouthy and the ring will decide who the true world champion is when they go toe to toe in the ring. He noted that he has learnt lessons from his last loss to Miroslav Pulev of Bulgaria, after which he regained his belts in the rematch and will never make the mistake of the match again. Though, a date and venue is yet to be picked for the match, Joshuaâ€™s promoter, Eddie Hearns, is touting June and England is not likely to be the venue because of Covid-19. The two boxers have been throwing verbal jabs at each other and Joshua has now come out to say the ultimate talk will be when they meet in the ring. The muli-million dollars fight estimated to fetch each o the fighters more than 200million pounds sterling already has a clause for a rematch no matter whoever takes the fist igh.
