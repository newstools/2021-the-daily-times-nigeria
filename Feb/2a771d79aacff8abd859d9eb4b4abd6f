By Ben Alaiya with agency reports There are strong indications that the Super Eagles will again play a competitive game in the Nations commercial nerve centre, Lagos 20 years after it last did so. Nigeria will play Benin Republic after its clash with Lesotho in a spate of one week, before coming home to Lagos. The last time the Super Eagles played a competitive match in Lagos was 20 years ago when they beat Zambia 1-0 in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on 13 January 2001 at the National Stadium in Surulere.

It will also be good or security and the health of the players. The National Stadium was earlier touted but it’s still work in progress, so the match will be played at the Teslim Balogun which has since returned to its natural after it was built with an artificial turf. Super Eagles’ only other match at the arena was the 2-1 defeat of Sierra Leone in a friendly match played on 9 February 2011.
