Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, Managing Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), has identified the National Maritime Transport Policy as key to unlocking the huge potential and vast opportunities in the nation’s blue economy. Bala-Usman said this in a statement issued by Ibrahim Nasiru, NPA Assistant General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications, issued to newsmen on Sunday in Lagos. According to her, a well-articulated National Maritime Transport Policy will support local content development and create good value jobs. She noted that the much anticipated policy would attract high-impacting direct foreign investments, within the context of the Federal Government’s Economic Growth and Sustainability Agenda. ”We look forward to a policy with clear Standard Operating Procedures that will guide our various operations, and that will be strengthened by critical legal framework and legislation from the National Assembly. ”The policy should engender a competitive maritime domain with clear rules on institutional governance, service capacity and accountability,” she said. The NPA boss also called for greater synergy and collaboration between the public and private sector stakeholders to advance the interest of the maritime industry in the country.
