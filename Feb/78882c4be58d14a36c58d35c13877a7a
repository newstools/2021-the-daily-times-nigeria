Former acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, has reacted to the appointment of Abdulrasheed Bawa as the new Chairman of the commission. Tosin Ajaomo, the lawyer to Magu, said the appointment made by President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday came as a shock. Buhari had yesterday asked the Senate to confirm Bawa as substantive EFCC Chairman. But Ajaomo told Channels Television that justice has not been served in the allegations of corruption levelled against his client, Magu. “Sincerely, I need to tell you that this appointment came to me as a shock. There is still an unfinished assignment that was pending,” he said. “I was expecting that the issue of Magu would have been sorted out before moving to another stage.
