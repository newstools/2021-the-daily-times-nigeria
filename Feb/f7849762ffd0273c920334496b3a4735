STEPHEN GBADAMOSI, IBADAN The ongoing membership registration exercise of the All Progressives Congress (APC) offers a unique opportunity for the Nigerian youths to achieve all the positive things they set to achieve with the #EndSARS protests, if they are prepared to end the passivity of quality youths in active politics. The chairman of Media and Publicity Committee for the Membership Registration and Revalidation Exercise in Oyo State, Mr. Kehinde Olaosebikan, said all the youths needed to do was to register for the party in good numbers at their various polling units and form the majority from the grassroots, where the lines of leadership and control beginan. Speaking on the South-West Political Circuit programme of a private radio station in Ibadan over the weekend, Olaosebikan told the youths that once they formed the majority at the polling units and subsequently at the wards, they were in good stead to take the control of the party and get well involved in forming the government at different levels.

Joined on the programme by Alhaji Gafar Ojetola , Honourable Wasiu Sadare and Ademola Solalu, members of the committee, Olaosebikan advised the youth to take full advantage of the opening provided by the well timed registration exercise taking place in more than two years before our next general elections to use the exercise in positioning themselves for leadership and greatness. Olaosebikan said the political situation in the country could be likened to what transpired in the 50s and 60s when the youths took the advantage of education to take over the leadership of the country from the elderly stating that the present youth should use the digital knowledge which they were born into positively against the analogue system of the old to propagate themselves constructively along with heir numerical strength. He, therefore, urged the youths in the 351 wards of Oyo State to mobilise themselves fruitfully and register for the APC, “the only party that is ready to welcome them on board and give them opportunity to develop and lead.” As already assured by the chairman of the Membership Revalidation and Registration Committee for Oyo State, Honourable Abubakar Bawa Bwari, Olaosebikan disclosed that there would not be any discrimination or exclusion of any sort in Oyo State and that the entire process had been made easy and seamless with the adequate trainings of supervisors at all levels. The actual registration exercise begins in all the polling units across the 33 local government areas of the state on Tuesday, 9 February.
