A revered Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, has embarked on another peace-seeking trip to the forest to encounter bandits. The cleric had met with bandits across forests in Zamfara State earlier this month, pleading to them to lower their weapons. Subsequently, he begged the government to pardon the fighting men in order to rule in peace. Sources revealed that between Tegina in the Niger State and Birnin Gwari in the Kaduna State was were Gumi met with the armed men. The development comes two days after the staff and students of the Government Science College, Kagara, Niger State, were taken hostage by armed men. Below are some images from the meeting.
