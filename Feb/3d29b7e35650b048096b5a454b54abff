â€¦Facilities ready, only three states fully set By Ben Alaiya With the February 14 start of the National Sports festival drawing closer there are fears that the games may again be shifted going by the stringent condition rolled out by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Covid-`19, headed by the Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha. The PTF has said there should be no gathering of more than 50 people at any event. But with 36 states and FCT Abuja expected at the festival that runs from February 14-28, it is most unlikely that the organisers can meet the PTF conditions. Only on Wednesday, the Main Organising Committee for the Festival (MOC), headed by Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, reduced the number of team sports from six to three in a desperate bid to meet PTF regulations but that may still not be enough for the festival to hold.
