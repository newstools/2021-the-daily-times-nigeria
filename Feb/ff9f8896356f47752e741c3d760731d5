Hours after the formal presidential candidate known as Adamu Garba unveiled and introduced many Nigerian to the business platform known as “Cow to Currency Networking” regarding the ban of Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin transactions by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to Rotimi Amaechi, that there are cows everywhere between Abuja to Kaduna and the ministry does not want to kill cows anymore.
