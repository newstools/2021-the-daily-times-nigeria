The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has said the party has not adopted a presidential candidate for the 2023 elections. Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP National Publicity Secretary said the party has not sold nomination form to any intending candidate, hence it has no flagbearer yet. Ologbondiyan made the clarification while faulting a report that PDP has adopted its former presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar as the party’s 2023 presidential candidate. The PDP spokesman also stressed that the opposition party was always ready to defend democracy. He assured that PDP will never support the imposition of candidates.
