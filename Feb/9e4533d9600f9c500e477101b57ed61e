He said the service had started sensitising the residents on how to prevent fire outbreaks as well as saving lives and property. The director lamented that despite series of sensitisation, fire outbreaks were still on the increase. He said: “We will not relent in our advocacy, as sensitisation still remains the best in handling fire outbreaks.” He urged the residents to always switch off their electrical appliances when not in used, advising business owners to install fire extinguishers in their premises.
