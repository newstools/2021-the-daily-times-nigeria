By Tom Garba, Yola The immediate past Governor of Adamawa State, Senator Muhammadu Umaru Jibrilla Bindow, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) remained the only party in Nigeria, as there could not be any other than the ruling party in the country. Jibrilla made this assertion in Yola on his way to participating in the party’s registration and revalidation exercise scheduled to commence tomorrow nationwide. He, also, reiterated the statement when he paid a courtesy call on Nash Radio, a newly established station by Mr. Halilu Modi in More Hills in Yola.

Bindow said: “I just heard it from you, I am the second person among the critical stakeholders to join APC in Adamawa when APC was created, our father HE Murtala Nyako is the first. Behold do we have any party in Nigeria apart from APC?” He said he was set for his membership card revalidation as an APC member in his 001 Unit, Kolere Ward of Mubi North Local Government of the state. Bindow enjoined his followers to come out en masse for registration and to renew their membership, saying, APC was the party to beat in 2023.
