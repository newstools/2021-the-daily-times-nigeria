The Imo State High Court in Owerri ordered the temporary forfeiture of all property allegedly obtained illegally while in office by the former Governor of the State, Rochas Okorocha. The injunction followed an application brought by Louis Alozie, Senior Advocate of Nigeria. Okorocha’s wife, Nkechi Okorocha, the Incorporated Trustees of the Rochas Foundation and the serving Senator himself were joined as parties to the application. The listed properties include Eastern Palm University, Ogboko; Royal Spring Palm Hotels and Apartments; IBC Staff Quarters, reportedly converted to private use by the Rochas Foundation College, Owerri Magistrate Quarters, Cooperative Office, and Girls Guide. Others are Kilimanjaro eatery; B/2 Otamiri South Extension Layout public building plot that was occupied as a Skills Acquisition Centre by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs but converted to Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha. The request is based on a white paper issued by the state government pursuant to the report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on the Okorocha administration’s dealings. The court action is the latest in an effort to strip Okorocha of assets allegedly acquired illegally while in government.
