The European Union (EU) has expelled Claudia Salerno Caldera, head of the Venezuelan Mission to the EU, and declared the diplomat persona non grata, media reports on Friday said. The EU decision followed Venezuela’s expulsion of the EU Ambassador to Venezuela, Isabel Brilhante Pedrosa and giving her 72 hours to leave. “The EU considers this declaration as wholly unwarranted and contrary to the EU’s objective of developing relations and building partnerships in third countries,” said a statement issued by the EU Council.

He described the actions of the European bloc as “interference,” noting the United Nations (UN) Charter only allows for coercive measures against countries at the approval of the UN Security Council.
