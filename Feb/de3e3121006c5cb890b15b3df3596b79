BY CHUKWUEMEKE IWELUNMO The effects on COVID-19 on air travel and its attendant effects on the country and the economy was made manifest as total tickets sold for the first quarter of 2020 decreased by $132 million. This is a sharp reduction of $282.35 million sold Q1 2019 by foreign carriers that operated in and out of the country. A data obtained from the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), captioned, “BSP Nigeria-R &S Monthly Reports-Market Data April 2020”. A breakdown of the figure shows that $57.79 million worth of tickets were sold in January 2019 alone. Ticket sales figures for February of the same year stood at $51.52 million; March $80.55 million; April $92.59 million bringing the total to $286.36 million. In contrast, January 2020 figure was regarded as the best month for air travel and one that surpassed the expectations of travel agents and other catalytic interests in the aviation and travel industry as the month saw high travel demand that amounted to $70.03 million. February 2020 saw ticket sales of $59.16 million; March figure stood at $23.26 million when the COVID-19 pandemic got to its peak and nations started closing their borders including restrictions that crippled travels. April 2020 saw a sharp decline of air travel as tickets sold amounted to $-1.36, a deficit for that month as the BSP recorded more refunds than new sales in April. As a result of that, the month of April became negative. The total tickets sold for the first quarter of 2020 decreased to $151 million. President, NANTA, Mrs Susan Akporiaye at a press conference lamented that the COVID-19 brought the entire sector to a halt, stressing that January 2020 was one of the best months for aviation because of huge sales made by foreign carriers.

Akporiaye further stated that February of last year was also good till the second week in March when nations started taking measures to limit the spread of coronavirus by shutting borders. According to her, “The whole of last year, especially from March was a difficult year as we have never had it so bad. Even the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently disclosed that 2020 was the worst year for aviation in many years. “Surprisingly, January 2020 was the best month for aviation in Nigeria in recent years. January of every year is usually very difficult for travel. First-quarter is usually slow for business but January 2020 was a windfall followed by the month of February. After March 2020, the industry took a tumble for the worst because of COVID-19”. She, however, berated the attitude of United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the controversial Rapid Antigen Testing (RDT), saying it was not a full-proof for detection, adding that the PCR test was more comprehensive and far better than the Antigen test, which she said puts a lot of strain on travellers with additional costs.
