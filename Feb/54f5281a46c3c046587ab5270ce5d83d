By Mutiat Alli Nigeria’s foremost artist Ikechukwu Ezeigwe and others showcased their works at the Artpedia Gallery Launch/Exhibition which held on the 20th of February, 2021 in Lekki Peninsula of Lagos State Nigeria, with Kennii Ekundayo as the Guest Curator. According to Ekundayo, “It is almost a prerequisite in many art shows to create a concept that introduces a completely fresh meaning and sense to a collection. The exhibition, The Persistence of Time, theorises the influence of time in artistic innovation. This was reflected in the interconnectedness of the 28 selected and displayed artworks by six artists who had independently produced each body of work at different times.” In attendance were Junkman Afrika, Steve Ekpenisi, Pretty Mike, Dadaboy Ehiz, other art collectors and art lovers. Remarkably, 13 of the exhibited artworks were sold on the opening day.
