Any cow found moving about between the hours of 6pm and 6am will be seized. The ban imposed on the use of motorcycles to check rising rate of crime is to be effected in full force as security agencies are to arrest anyone caught. These resolutions were taken after a meeting held with Governor Godwin Obaseki, Heads of Security Agencies, Ogheghe Community leaders and the leadership of Arewa Community in Benin City against the backdrop of a recent clash between residents of Ogheghe and members of Arewa in Benin City which led to the destruction of properties.
