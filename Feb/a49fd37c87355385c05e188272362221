*Urges Senate to turn down request for confirmation Tunde Opalana, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the nomination of the immediate past service chiefs, describing the move as plots by the Buhari Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to use the decoy of ambassadorial appointments to shield from investigation over alleged killing of innocent Nigerians and crimes against humanity on government’s watch. The PDP charged the Senate to eschew all partisan considerations and stand on the side of the people, particularly the victims of atrocious regime of the ex-service chiefs by outright rejecting the demand by President Muhammadu Buhari to confirm them as ambassadors. The party insisted that is indeed sacrilegious and a horrible assault on the sensibility of Nigerians that the APC government is seeking to use ambassadorial appointments as desperate measure to secure diplomatic immunity for the former commanders and protect them from investigation, arrest and possible prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the atrocities committed against innocent Nigerians under their command. The PDP in a statement Thursday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, asserted that appointing the former service chiefs as ambassadors would confer diplomatic immunity on them and provide them a route for escape. “The party further stated that taking such actions at a time the ICC has declared its readiness to commence full investigation on their alleged involvement in the crime against humanity in our country, appears to further validate the allegations against them.

The PDP, therefore called on Nigerians, across board, to unite in rejecting these ambassadorial nominations for the accused former commanders and demand that President Buhari should immediately withdraw their nominations from the Senate. It said that it is expected of President Buhari is to direct the former service chiefs to answer for the alleged crimes.
