The death of the former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, was described as a colossal tragedy by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. He was personally touched, Gbajabiamila said, by the death of Jakande, whom he described as a man of peace who lived his life to serve humanity. Jakande, who died at the age of 91, was said by the Speaker to be badly missed for his developmental success in the state. He added that the invaluable contributions of Jakande to make Lagos State what it is today will never be erased, the role he played in Lagos State’s economic and political life, especially when between 1979 and 1983 he served as Governor. He did so tirelessly and with a lot of commitment as Minister of Works between 1993 and 1998; the Speaker described the former Governor as an incarnation of change. The Speaker remembered Jakande’s active political presence and said, without resentment, he played politics and ensured that Lagosians were taken along. Gbajabiamila commiserates with the Jakande family, the citizens of Lagos State, and the Government of Lagos State about the loss and prays to God for the rest of his soul.
