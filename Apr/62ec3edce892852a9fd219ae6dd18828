The Inspector-General of Police, Ag. IGP Usman Alkali Baba, NPM, psc (+), fdc has unveiled a new policing vision and crime-fighting strategies for the Nigeria Police Force. The IGP made the new operational protocols public, today, Thursday, 15th April, 2021, during the inaugural conference with Zonal Assistant Inspectors General of Police, Commissioners of Police and other Heads of Police Formations in the country, at the Force Headquarters, Abuja. The highlights of the new policing vision include; deploying cutting-edge policing technology and integrating intelligence-led policing practices to core policing functions, with a view to strengthening police capacity to stabilise the internal security order and restore public confidence in the Force. The new policing vision equally seeks to, among other things, give full effect to the concept of community policing and deliver quality police service that will be guided by the principles of public accountability and conformity to the rule of law. It will also embrace the social content of policing in which police officers see themselves as compassionate servants and helpers of the citizens.
