No fewer than 8,439 persons across the country have reported mild side effects after they received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. This was disclosed by the government, through its healthcare agency, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), on Friday in Abuja. Speaking during a press conference, NPHCDA Executive Director, Faisal Shuaib, said those who reported severe side effects were less than 100, adding that there has been no record of death or blood clots associated with the distribution of the vaccine. “Out of over a million persons given the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, 8,439 persons have suffered mild adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and 52 persons moderate to severe adverse events on receiving the jab,” Shuaib said.
