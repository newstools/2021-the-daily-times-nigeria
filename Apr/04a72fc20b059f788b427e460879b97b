Valencia was forced to abandon their La Liga match against Cádiz in the 32nd minute after Mouctar Diakhaby was allegedly racially abused by Juan Cala. The entire Valencia team, including players on the bench and support staff, walked off the field in protest. When the game continued, Diakhaby was substituted, while Cala remained on the pitch. Both players were given an yellow card each. “We offer our complete backing to Diakhaby. The player, who had received a racial insult, requested that his teammates return to the pitch,” Valencia said in a statement.
