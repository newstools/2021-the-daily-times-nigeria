A first-half penalty from Kane, who became England’s leading penalty scorer, looked like it had set the hosts on the way to a routine victory. Moder, however, had other ideas as he beat Pope in the second half, courtesy of Stones’ mistake at the back. Stones then made up for his error, heading down for Maguire to smash past Szczesny in the 85th minute. England runs out 2-1 winners at Wembley Stadium and they currently top Group I, with three wins in three games this international break. Austria and Romania are England’s next opponents, albeit in friendlies, while Poland will face Iceland. Both these teams will then take to European Championship action in June, with Southgate’s side playing Croatia and Sousa’s men going up against Slovakia in their first fixtures.
