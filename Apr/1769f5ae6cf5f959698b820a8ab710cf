Owing to mounting evidence linking the AstraZeneca vaccine to rare blood clots, the UK’s vaccine advisory body says that under-30s will be given an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca vaccine. According to the MHRA, 79 people in the UK had suffered unusual blood clots as a result of vaccination by the end of March, with 19 of them dying. This, according to the regulator, isn’t evidence that the jab triggered the clots. The connection, however, was said to be strengthening. The FDA stated that adverse effects were exceedingly rare and that the vaccine’s efficacy had been demonstrated. According to the study, this meant that the vaccine’s effects were still very favorable for the vast majority of people. However, since the danger from Covid was so much smaller, they conceded that it was more finely balanced for younger people. The JCVI, the government’s vaccine advisory committee, recommended that people aged 18 to 29 be given an alternative vaccine if one was available as a result of the study. And if you’ve already had the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, you can get a second dose. Only those who developed one of these unusual blood clots after receiving the first dose should avoid vaccination, according to the MHRA. Before getting vaccinated, people with blood disorders that put them at risk of clotting should talk to their doctor about the benefits and risks. Women accounted for almost two-thirds of the cases of unusual clots. The victims ranged in age from 18 to 79 years old.
