A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Victor Afam Ogene, has expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would win the forthcoming November 6, gubernatorial election in Anambra State. Daily Times gathered that the recent resolve by 21 former lawmakers of the APC in Anambra State to jointly work for the victory of the party at the election is a master stroke against the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the poll. No fewer than 21 APC former lawmakers in Anambra State, including Senator Emma Anosike, Senator Margery Okadigbo, Hons Ralph Okeke, Victor Afam Ogene, Chizor Obidigwe, Dom Obiekie, Peter Onuora and Theo Nnoroms, among others were said to have met recently at Senator Anosike’s country-home at Umueri, Anambra-East local government area and agreed to mobilise for the victory of APC in the governorship election.
