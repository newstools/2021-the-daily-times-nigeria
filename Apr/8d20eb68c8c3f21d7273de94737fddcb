It’s honours even after the first leg of the Champions League semi-final clash between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Christian Pulisic put the Blues ahead with a composed finish, but Karim Benzema equalized with a volley from close range. Neither side could add to the scoreline in the second half as the quality dipped after the break. Thomas Tuchel and his team will be satisfied with their efforts, notching a crucial away goal that could be decisive in the return leg next week. Both sides are in domestic action before the second leg on 5 May at Stamford Bridge. Real Madrid host Osasuna in LaLiga on Saturday, while Chelsea are also at home on the same day against Fulham in the Premier League. Meawhile, Christian Pulisic made U.S. history on Tuesday after a finely taken goal which put Chelsea ahead in their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. The Pennsylvania native needed just 14 minutes to open the scoring at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano and give the Blues the perfect start to their tie. And in doing so he managed a feat which none of his compatriots had ever achieved in the history of the competition. Pulisic’s goal was the first time a U.S. men’s international has ever managed to score in a Champions League semi-final. Indeed, only three of his compatriots can also boast a knockout goal in the competition: DaMarcus Beasley, Jermaine Jones and Tyler Adams, who scored for RB Leipzig in the 2019-20 quarter-finals to down Atletico Madrid. The goal also meant Pulisic is now the highest-scoring American in Champions League history, with his fifth career goal in the competition breaking the record previously held by Beasley. The Chelsea star is also the first U.S.-born player to score a competitive goal against Real Madrid.
