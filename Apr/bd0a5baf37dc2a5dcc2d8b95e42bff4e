The Eastern Security Network (ESN) has a new commander, according to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). This comes just 24 hours after security operatives raided ESN’s operational headquarters in Awomama Village, Imo state, killing Commander Ikonso and other members of the group in a joint operation. The party, on the other hand, declined to reveal his identity. The IPOB Secretary, Emma Strong, denied ESN’s involvement in Saturday’s assault on the residence of Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. “The ESN were not the ones who broke into Uzodinma’s home. “They can’t come in for an operation and claim to be ESN,” Powerful said.
