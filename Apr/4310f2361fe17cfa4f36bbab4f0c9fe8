After guiding Team Edo to a 3-2 victory over Team Lagos in the final of the men’s football event of the 20th edition in Benin City on Monday, Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu made history as the country’s first major political office holder to win a football gold medal at the National Sports Festival. With five minutes left to play, Shaibu, who is also the Chairman of the festival’s Local Organising Committee, came on with Edo leading and helped secure the scoreline after a late onslaught by their opponents. In the final match, played at the University of Benin’s sports complex, Team Edo came back from two goals down to defeat Lagos, with Solomon Osagie scoring the game-winning goal from the penalty spot in the 76th minute. Shaibu received a standing ovation as he warmed up before being introduced in the 85th minute. The Deputy Governor, while speaking after the match said, “I’m excited that Team Edo won, but for me, it is Lagos and Team Edo that won because it is a unity game. Both teams were very tactical and good. From two goals down, my boys equalised and went on to win with the God of football on our side.”
