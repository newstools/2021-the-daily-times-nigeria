This is in relationto the renewed wanton killings of innocent Fulani people in Zangon Kataf LGA anddestruction of their properties. “In the past few days, there have been series of deliberately targeted killings by the Atyap communities on Fulani people including two Ardos namely: Ardo Pate Kurmi (Wakilin Fulani in the Atyap Chiefdom) and Ardo Muhammadu Anchau who were brutally killed in cold blood after embarking on a peace mission to Gora District of the Atyap Chiefdom”, they said. According to the MACBAN, the killing of their leaders was allegedly mastermind through connivance and tacit support of Security operatives. “Their killing was orchestrated in a systematic way with active connivance or tacit support of the Officer In-charge (0/c) of Operation Safe Haven stationed at Gora Gan village,Gora District. “This is because the attack that culminated into the brutal killing of the two Ardos and one other person started right at the camp of the OperationSate Haven at Gora Gan when some Atyap women erupted into the protest, attacking the Ardos and other three Fulani people that were with them. “Notwithstanding the violent protests, the officers of Operation Safe Haven asked the Ardos to be driven by the Secretary to the District Head of Gora District (one Ayuba Bungwon) without any security cover.“Unfortunately, they were intercepted on the road along Sagwaza and the two Ardos and one other person by name Muhammed Yakubu got brutally killed.“As the Almighty would have it, two young persons were able to overrun the attackers and narrowly escaped”, the Fulani group stated. According to them, there were several other attacks on Fulani people and their livestock in Zango Kataf LGAs and surrounding Local Governments.In Kagarko grazing reserve in kagarko local government area of Kaduna state, MACBAN stated that “It is imperative to also inform you; gentlemen of the press about the antics and deliberate destruction of Fulani settlements in the Kagarko grazing reserve by one Vice Admiral Iko Ibrahim (r.t.d) who is a former Chief of Naval Staff who have been going about intimidating, harassing and torturing of Fulani communitymembers of the grazing reserve on the pretext that he is the owner of over 30, 000 hectares in the grazing reserve. “The said Vice Admiral lko Ibrahim have been conniving with the military personnel manning the roadblock at kagarko town usually enter the grazing reserve n their Hilux vehicle in a commando-style subjecting the residents of the grazing reserve to series. “The association notes that unless drastic measures are taken by the relevant serious security to bring about peace in the grazing reserve and the entire Kagarko because of the burning of their hamlets and other valuables.
