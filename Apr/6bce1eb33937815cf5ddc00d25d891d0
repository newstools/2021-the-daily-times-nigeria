In what appears like a subtle campaign for Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello’s presidential ambition ahead of 2023, a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, has taken to his verified social media handles to tell Nigerians who to elect as president in the next election. He said Nigerians have the choice to make or mar the country’s chance of being one united country. Although, Fani-Kayode didn’t mention Bello’s name in the post made on Tuesday morning, he, however, posted the governor’s picture alongside nine others, who are likely to throw their hats in the ring with attributes suggesting he was referring to the Kogi governor, who has become his new political ally lately. The order of the pictures also speaks volume as Bello’s is on top of others – Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi, Alh. Atiku Abubakar, Governor Mai Mala Buni, Governor Dave Umahi, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, former governor Ayodele Fayose, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, and Governor Ben Ayade, in that order.
