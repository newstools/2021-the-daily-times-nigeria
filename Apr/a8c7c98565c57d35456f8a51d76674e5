Kelechi Iheanacho scored a spectacular goal and set up another as Leicester came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1, boosting their Champions League qualification hopes. Wilfried Zaha shocked Leicester when he put Palace ahead inside 12 minutes – his fourth goal in four games at the King Power Stadium. But Iheanacho sparked the Foxes’ spirited second-half fightback, setting up Timothy Castagne for the equaliser within five minutes of the restart, before emphatically rifling in his 14th goal in 14 games in all competitions to complete the turnaround 10 minutes from time. Having threatened to leave the door to Champions League qualification ajar for their top-four rivals, the victory sees Leicester consolidate the third spot, seven points clear of fifth-placed West Ham, while Palace remains 13th, 11 points clear of the relegation zone but not yet mathematically safe.
