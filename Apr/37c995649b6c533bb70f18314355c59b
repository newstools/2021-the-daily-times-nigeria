Jaafar Jaafar, Daily Nigerian publisher has gone into hiding due to daily threats over the alleged bribery videos involving Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje A close media associate told PRNigeria that unknown persons have been on the pressman’s trail. “Jaafar’s life is in danger as unidentified persons, likely to be hit men, have been stalking him both at his Abuja and Kano residences,” the ally said. In 2018, Jaafar released footages of Ganduje receiving stacks of dollars. The cash was alleged to be kickbacks from contractors handling projects awarded by the Kano State Government. The Ganduje administration dismissed the authenticity of the videos. Information Commissioner, Muhammad Garba claimed it was “doctored”. In a recent interview with BBC Hausa, Ganduje said those who publicized the video would be dealt with. In reaction, Jaafar petitioned former Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, through his counsel, Abdullahi Gumel.
