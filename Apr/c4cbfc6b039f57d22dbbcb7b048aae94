On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced that 25 million additional stimulus payments totaling $36 billion had been sent out to Americans as part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief law. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service announced the release of a fourth batch of checks. It takes the total number of payments made to 156 million, with a total value of $372 billion. Treasury said in a statement that the new payments of up to $1,400 started processing last Friday, with some people receiving direct deposits. The pandemic-wounded US economy is on the mend, with 916,000 new jobs added last month, taking the unemployment rate down to 6%.
