In Anambra State, police have detained a suspect in connection with the assault on Professor Charles Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwum, stated this in a statement on Thursday. Professor Soludo, who is vying for the governorship election in Anambra, attended a stakeholders’ meeting with politicians and others at the Isuofia Civic Centre in the state’s Aguata Local Government Area. On Wednesday evening, while the meeting was in progress, a group of gunmen invaded the venue and engaged the security forces in a gunfight. As a result, the assailants kidnapped Emeka Ezenwanne, the state’s Commissioner of Public and Utilities. Following the incident, Monday Kuryas, the Commissioner of Police in Anambra, led a crack team of police operatives to the scene for an on-the-spot assessment. According to him, the police chief condemned the incident and expressed his condolences to the officers’ families and friends who paid the ultimate price. He also ordered that an investigation into the incident be launched right away in order to uncover the mystery surrounding it and bring the perpetrators to justice. Kuryas urged Anambra residents to join forces with the police in the fight against crime and criminality in the state.
