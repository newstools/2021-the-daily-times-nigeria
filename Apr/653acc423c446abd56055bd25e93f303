The Lunhinga mine in Angolaâ€™s eastern province of Lunda Norte is expected to produce 20,000 carats of diamonds per month, according to the coordinator of the Lunhinga project. Aderito Gaspar told the press that the mine, located in Xa-cassau commune in the municipality of Lucapa, would double its production from the current 10,000 carats monthly to 20,000 carats from the second half of this year. He said that the increase in diamond production was due to the entry into operation of a new treatment plant, which is scheduled for the second half of 2021. The project, which has a concession area of 32,500 hectares, will be explored over a period of five years. The mine produced 322,730 carats of diamonds from 2017 to 2020, Gaspar said. (Xinhua/NAN)
