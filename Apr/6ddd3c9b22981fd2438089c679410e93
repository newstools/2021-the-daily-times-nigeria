Reno Omokri, the convener of the #HarassBuhariOutofLondon Movement, has revealed the reason for the suspension of protests against President Muhammadu Buhari’s medical trip to London. The demonstrations were put on hold in the spirit of Ramadan, according to Omokri. On Tuesday, April 13, he released a statement titled “Ramadan: Temporary Suspension of #HarassBuhariOutofLondon Protests.” Omoyele Sowore’s #BuhariMustGo campaign has also been asked to call a halt to the demonstrations, according to Omokri. “We have agreed to temporarily suspend #HarassBuhariOutofLondon due to the Ramadan fast, which started today, April 13, 2021, to allow General Muhammadu Buhari to observe his fast in peace,” he said.
