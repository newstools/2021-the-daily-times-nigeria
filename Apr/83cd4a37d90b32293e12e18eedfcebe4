After sustaining an injury while on international duty, Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos is doubtful for the Clasico against Barcelona and the Champions League quarter-final against Liverpool. Following a previous injury layoff, the centre-back returned to action with Spain earlier this week, only for the club to announce that he has a muscle problem in his left leg. It means the 36-year-old is almost likely to miss Zinedine Zidane’s side’s vital match next week, as Jurgen Klopp’s Reds fly to the Spanish capital with a semi-final spot on the line over the two legs. After missing most of 2021 due to a knee injury and then a calf problem, the Blancos captain came on as a late substitute in Luis Enrique’s side’s win over Kosovo earlier this week. He only came on in the 86th minute. Now he seems to have suffered yet another injury, with the club announcing that they are awaiting further results before deciding how long he will be out, with news indicating that it may be up to a month. “Our captain Sergio Ramos was diagnosed with a muscle injury in his left leg after the tests carried out today by the Real Madrid medical services,” Madrid said in an official statement. “It’s all being analyzed.”
