Kelly Hansome, a veteran musician, has accused Mavin Records manager Michael Collins Ajereh, better known as Don Jazzy, of arresting him with police operatives. Don Jazzy reportedly arrested Kelly Hansome, handcuffed him from Kano to Abuja, and intimidated him with his pets, according to Kelly Hansome. The singer said this in response to Don Jazzy’s latest interview with Ebuka, in which he dared anyone to accuse him of any wrongdoing. Don Jazzy had said: “I want somebody to come outside and beat their chest and say Don Jazzy did not treat me right. “Then at that point, we might now be responding to something. don’t think there is anybody on the surface of earth that would say, this is what Don Jazzy did to me, whether boyfriend, girlfriend that would just say this is what I did. I go out of my way…ask the people close to me, I dey take pain for people.” In response to Don Jazzy’s argument that he has never harmed anyone, Kelly Hansome disclosed that he was arrested by the music producer with men from the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). He added: “Did he also state when he and his girlfriend arrested me with SARS and moved me from Kano to Abuja in handcuffs? “No he won’t say that part but it happened. Did he say when he sent his dogs to intimidate me and @rexidaminabo? No. Thank God Festus Keyamo is still alive.”
