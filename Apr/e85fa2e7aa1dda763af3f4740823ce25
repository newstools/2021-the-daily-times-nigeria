Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri has cautioned local government area chairmen in the state to sit up and live up to the standards of the electorate or face the consequences. The governor issued the alert while speaking at a stakeholder meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, which was held at Government House. Yola was summoned at his request to include a report card on his administration during his nearly two years in office. “In the state, I’ve received several complaints and accusations against local government chairmen. I’m proud of some of them for caring for their communities, but others aren’t living up to their potential. For the last time, I want to alert all chairmen, especially those who have refused to reform, to do so and correct their mistakes, or else they will be held responsible,” he said.
