Harry Kane became England’s all-time top penalty scorer with his goal from the spot against Poland on Wednesday. Kane opened the scoring in the 19th minute of the World Cup qualifier at Wembley, before Poland equalized in the 58th minute through Jakub Moder. But England would prevail 2-1 after Harry Maguire’s late winner, making it three wins from three to begin qualification for Qatar 2022. In addition, Kane has now scored on all seven days of the week for England, becoming only the third player to do so for the Three Lions, after Wayne Rooney and Lampard. The Tottenham striker has been in prolific form for England in recent years, as he has now been involved in 30 goals in 21 European Championship/World Cup qualifying matches (22 goals, 8 assists), Kane has scored at least once in each of his last 12 such appearances, stretching back to October 2017. With 34 international goals, Kane continues to chase down Wayne Rooney’s all-time England record of 53. Kane is already sixth on England’s all-time scoring chart, with just Rooney, Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker, Jimmy Greaves, and Michael Owen ahead of him. The Spurs star will be back with his club side at the weekend, with Tottenham set to face Newcastle on Sunday. Tottenham currently sits sixth in the Premier League, three points outside of the top four.
