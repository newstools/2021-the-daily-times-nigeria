On Tuesday, April 13, 2021, suspected Boko Haram members invaded Damasak, the headquarters of the troubled Borno state’s Mobbar local government area, and wreaked havoc without fighting. Armed insurgents destroyed the Divisional Police Command, schools, shops, and residential houses this time while hoisting their flags in strategic locations. Three soldiers were killed by insurgents in Damasak last Sunday, while six innocent civilians were killed by an airstrike while attending a naming ceremony. In addition to looting medical supplies at the General Hospital Damasak, the insurgents destroyed most humanitarian hubs and facilities. Damasak is about 180 kilometers north of Maiduguri, the state capital, and is a border community with the Niger Republic. The Chairman of Mobbar Local Government Area, Hon Mustapha Bunu Kolo, confirmed the latest Damasak attack and killings, telling Vanguard that the latest attack was troubling because the remaining humanitarian hubs in the town were razed down, including the Police Station, Market, shops, and residential houses. “Yes, there was another devastating Boko Haram attack in Damasak right now. “Though I am not in Damasak, as I travelled out for official engagement, but based on the information at my disposal, the insurgents invaded the town since 5 pm and are still holding ground as at this time (10:40 pm). ”The insurgents have succeeded in razing down remaining humanitarian hubs, market, shops, and an unspecified number of residential houses, as they detonated their Improvised Explosive Devices, IEDs, without confrontation. “I was also informed that many people lost their lives in the attack, but I don’t have the actual number of casualties as the insurgents are still much around to continue wreaking havoc on innocent civilians,” Kolo stated. At press time, all attempts to obtain confirmation from Edet Okon, the Police Public Relations Officer, had failed.
