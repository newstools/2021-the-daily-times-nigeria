On Monday, the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) began a nationwide strike over the judiciary’s financial autonomy. Comrade Jimoh, the union’s National Treasurer, who is leading the demonstration, has stated that they will continue to strike and protest until their demands are met. JUSUN shut down all courts in the country on April 6 in protest of governors’ failure to follow the constitution’s provisions for judicial financial autonomy. However, after failing to reach an agreement with the governors, JUSUN threatened to add mass protests to the strike on Friday.
