President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday hosted his Nigerien counterpart, Mohamed Bazoum, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The visiting Nigerien leader, who is on a two-day official visit to Nigeria, was received by President Buhari at the forecourt of the villa at about 1.22p.m. Among those who joined the president to welcome Bazoum are the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammed Bello, and some presidential aides. The governors of Sokoto, Borno, Yobe, Kebbi, and Zamfara states were also at the villa to welcome Bazoum, who was sworn in for the first five-year term as President of Niger Republic on April 2.
