Barcelona extends their LaLiga winning streak to six games, moving a point behind league-leaders Atletico Madrid in the process. First-half efforts from Pedri and Kodro were only denied by the frame of the respective goals before the game came to life in the second half. Plano’s dismissal for a sliding tackle on Dembele encouraged the hosts, who grabbed a crucial, late winner from Dembele at the back post in the 90th minute. It’s all over at Camp Nou, where the hosts eventually run out 1-0 winners. Koeman’s attentions will now turn to Saturday, where his side face Real Madrid, who sit two points behind Barcelona in third. Valladolid, who put in a fighting effort against the hosts, remain in 16th and they host Granada.
