The Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has denied that he would bestow a traditional title on former presidential candidate Adamu Garba. On May 1, 2021, Garba declared that the monarch will bestow the title of Aare Atunluse of Oodua upon him. Ooni deemed Garba “worthy of the title of Aare Atunluse Oodua Award of Honor to be bestowed on the 3rd World Omoluabi day 1st May 2021,” according to Garba. He distributed a letter of invitation to the Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye’s World Omoluabi Day Festival. A statement by Ooni’s Director of Media and, Moses Olafare, dissociated him from the award.
