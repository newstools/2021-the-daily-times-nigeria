By Mutiat Alli Actor and international businessman Lordmansamusa recently put up a show of fatherhood exuberance as he celebrated the first birthday of his second son. On his Instagram page, @lordmansamusa, he posted: “It’s my second son’s first birthday. Welcome to first of many more birthday celebrations my son. May God bless you, may God guide you, may God protect you, may God keep you Holy, may your life be prosperous so whatever you do may prosper!” Explaining the reason for such display of ebullience on social media, Lordmanmusa, whose real name is Olaniyi Daniel Adedeji, disclosed that the child was born in the heat of the Covid-19 pandemic when the world went into lockdown. “Happy birthday to my pandemic baby,” he posted. While the world will remember 2020 for its devastation of lives and economies, Lordmansamusa, who is also a youth ambassador, insisted that the birth of his second son gave him a reason to remember the year in good light. “It was a year of tears and despair for mankind, but God gifted me a son in the middle of a pandemic. That is why his first year birthday means so much to me,” he gushed. Despite his busy schedule as a frequent traveller due to his business that took him around the world, Lordmansa said his family comes first before any other thing. “International business is time-consuming, but thoughts of my family keep me happy in any part of the world I go to,” he said. Lordmansamusa added: “Once I am not on a business trip, I try to spend my time with my family, with the kids especially.”
