In what seemed a planned abuse, fans, officials, and boxers of Team Ogun went crazy on Tuesday at the boxing event of the National Sports Festival in Edo State after a decision went against one of their boxers. The fight between Lagos boxer, Shittu Afolabi, and Ogun boxer, Kasali Abayomi, in the 52kg division ended in a 3-2 split decision in favour of the Lagos boxer. Team Ogun, on the other hand, mobilized officials, supporters, and boxers to attack the referees and other officials, hurling chairs, tables, and other dangerous weapons even in the presence of the Ogun State Commissioner for Sports, who was seated as one of the special guests. Normalcy has yet to return to the festival’s site, as of the time of this report. In the meantime, security personnel have arrived on the scene.
