Ukpono Ukpong, Abuja A mild drama ensued yesterday when members of Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) walked out of a meeting called at the instance of Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, to discuss the ongoing industrial action by the groups. The meeting was scheduled for 3pm.Both members of JUSUN and PASAN who were seated at 3pm stage a walked out after waiting for almost two hours without being attended to. Speaking with newsmen, JUSUN national public relations officer, Comrade Koin Selepreye, said it was wrong for the minister to keep the workers for that long, when the invitation sent to them clearly started that the meeting was for 3pm. She said the union would always be available for meetings, but won’t take it when time schedules was not respected. Also speaking, the National President of PASAN, Comrade Mohammed Usman, barrated the minister for what he described as “unfair treatment melted on the workers.” He said the workers respect time and won’t accept being kept for a meeting which should be taken seriously, considering the importance of the issues at stake. Effort by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Dr. Peter Yerima Yarfa, and the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on National Niger Affairs, Ita Enang, to prevail on the unions to return for the meeting met a brick wall as they entered their cars and left. At the meeting were the representative of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Inspector General of Police, NJIC, and head legal team of the Nigerian Governors Forum.
