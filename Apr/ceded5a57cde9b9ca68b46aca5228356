Real Madrid took a major step towards the semi-finals of the Champions League with a 3-1 first-leg win over Liverpool at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano. Vinicius Junior was Liverpool’s chief tormentor, punishing basic errors from a visiting side that employed a high line without any pressure on the ball and seemed to lack the basic organization required to repel the pace of the Madrid frontline. After the Brazilian ghosted in behind to net a first in the 27th minute, Trent Alexander-Arnold miscued a clearing header to allow Marco Asensio to creep in behind, lobbing Alisson and tapping into an empty net. For a time early in the second half, Liverpool looked like being a force in the contest and Mohamed Salah’s thundering strike in off the crossbar gives them something to cling on to ahead of next Wednesday’s second leg even if a second goal for Vinicius means it will require an almighty effort at Anfield if Jurgen Klopp’s side are to qualify for the last four.
