In Crotone’s 4-3 loss to Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Saturday afternoon, striker Simeon Tochukwu Nwankwo equaled an Italian Serie A record. When he scored in the 25th minute with a right-footed shot, he became the first player in the Premier League to score in five consecutive games – seven goals in five games. After Milan legend George Weah in September 1996 and Keita Balde in May 2017, he is the third African player in Serie A history to score for five consecutive appearances, according to Sky Sport Italia. The Nigerian international scored his first goal against Atalanta, then added a brace against Torino and Lazio, before scoring again against Bologna on Saturday. Simy is gaining in stature and confidence this season, with 15 goals in 29 league games demonstrating his strong form. The Nigerian is the first player since Paulo Dybala (who played for Palermo in 2014-2015) to score in five consecutive games for a newly-promoted side. No player in Europe’s top five leagues, including Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski (7 goals), Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema (6 goals), and Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho, has scored more goals in the last month than him.
