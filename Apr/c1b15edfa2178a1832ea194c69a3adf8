The Peoples Democratic (PDP) Party Governors have scheduled to meet in Makurdi, Benue State capital on Friday to discuss the state of Nigeria and the party. Recall that the governors on Thursday took steps to prevent the rumoured plans by Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Daily Times gathered that Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Umaru Fintiri (Adamawa), and Aminu Waziri Tambuwal (Sokoto), visited Matawalle in Gusau and persuaded him to remain with the PDP. The Governors thereafter journeyed to Sokoto State to commission the newly constructed Ultra-modern Tor Tiv Palace and other projects in Gboko Local Government of the State. The meeting would be the first to be held physically outside Abuja, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. A statement by the party’s Director-General, Cyril Maduabum, said the meeting also aimed at reviewing the state of the party to strengthen it for future tasks.
