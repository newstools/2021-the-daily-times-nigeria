Tunde Opalana, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Sunday asked President Muhammadu Buhari should immediately sack the minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami as it called on the Department of State Services (DSS) to immediately invite the minister for questioning over alleged affiliations with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The party hinged the demands on the sensitivity of the issue at stake and heightening concerns in the public space and in the international arena of possible compromises by the communication minister, who has access to sensitive government documents and information, in addition to data of all individuals including high profile personalities in the public and private sectors as well as the traditional and faith-based circles. The PDP particularly expressed worries about allegations in the public suggesting that the minister compromised the NIN registration exercise by giving room for the registration of aliens and invaders from other countries as Nigerian citizens. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, tasked the DSS to investigate the allegation, which has created apprehension, particularly given the rise in banditry and other terrorists activities in the country. The PDP urged Nigerians to remain at alert and very sensitive to their environment, while not hesitating in providing useful information to security agencies in the interest of the nation.
