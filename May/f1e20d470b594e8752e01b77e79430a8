Six people are in critical condition in a Kuala Lumpur hospital after a driver’s negligence caused two trains to collide in Malaysia, according to the country’s Transport Minister, Wee Ka Siong. A statement by the ministry said that out of the 64 people who had been hospitalised late on Monday after the crash, 15 others remained in a semi-critical condition. Some 213 people were injured when two light-rail transit (LRT) trains collided late on Monday evening close to the Petronas Towers, once the world’s tallest building. One of the trains was on a test run when the collision took place shortly after 8:30 pm (1230 GMT) on an underground section of the line between two city-centre stations. Wee said that the driver of the empty train was at fault. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has ordered an investigation into the crash and requested that the injured and hospitalised receive comprehensive treatment.
