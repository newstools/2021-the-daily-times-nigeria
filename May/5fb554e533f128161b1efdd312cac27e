Ify Onwuemene, a Nollywood actress, died of cancer. Gloria Anozie-Young, a colleague, corroborated this on her Facebook page. Ify died on Tuesday after a long battle with endometrial cancer. She was best known for her role in the popular sitcom “Everyday People.” “We regret to announce that IFEY ONWUEMENE has gone to be with the Lord, with a deep sense of grief but entire surrender to God Almighty,” Anozie-Young wrote. “IFEY ONWUEMENE was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Her womb was removed, but she has been battling the ailment for many years now. “In 2019, even after eight sessions of chemotherapy, the doctors told her she had reached stage 4. However, we are not sure if she was given the wrong diagnosis or being treated with the wrong chemo, because she still felt pains on her upper abdomen and her tummy was bloated. “Ify spent more than N10m, being helped with donations by her fellow actors and other Nigerians. A GoFundMe account was opened for her, but it did not yield much. She had to go for draining every two weeks at a cost of N280,000, but only 3 litres of liquid can be removed at a time so that her heart is not affected. “IFEY has finally gone to rest, today 25th May 2021. May her soul rest in perfect peace. Amen.”
