The Ogun State Technical Team is investigating the causes of several gas explosions in Abeokuta, and a retail outlet has been shut down. Six people were killed and eight others were wounded in five separate gas explosions in different parts of the state capital. The Technical Team, which includes members of the Nigerian Police Force, the Department of State Security, the Department of Petroleum Resources, the Fire Service, and the Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON), has been moving from location to location to determine the cause of the explosions.
