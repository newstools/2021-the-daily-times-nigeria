By Kingsley Chukwuka A Local Government Chairman in Plateau State, Hon. Ubandoma Laven has called on the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency allow the Vigilante group to carry arms. Laven, who is the Council boss in Langtang North LGA, said the growing trend of kidnapping, banditry and insurgency has become overwhelming that security agencies can no longer contain. “It is no longer news that the capacity of the Nigeria Police today cannot curtail the rising trend of criminal violence in the society, hence the need for community policing like the vigilante group”. The LG boss stated this at the weekend in Langtang LGA during an honor granted to him as the Patron of Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN). “Vigilante groups should be permitted by the Federal Government to carry light arms so that they can effectively police their environment. You cannot go after kidnappers and bandits with bare hands as doing so will endanger their lives in the line of duties. “Peace, security and well being of Nigerians remains paramount and a panacea for economic and political development of the country. “There is an urgent need for the government at the three tiers to support the vigilante group of Nigeria by training and empowering them to support the fight against crimes such as armed robbery, banditry, kidnapping and all forms of anti-social behaviours in the society. “I make bold to say that the vigilante groups are more closer to the communities and if properly engaged, they can contribute in addressing the overwhelming security challenges bedevilling the nation”, Laven said. Responding, the Admin Commander of Vigilante Group of Nigeria, Plateau State Command, Abubakar Sadiq, said the LG boss was chosen from among many others to be their Patron because of his contribution to the growth and development of his immediate community
