On Tuesday, members of the House of Representatives urged the Inspector General of Police, Alkali Baba, to take over the murder investigation of Miss Iniubong Umoren, who was lured to Akwa Ibom by a phony job offer. The resolution of the House followed after the matter was raised by Unyime Idem, representing Ukanafun/Oruk Anam the federal constituency of Akwa Ibom State. Idem told the House that the family of the deceased raised an alarm of receiving threats of various degrees from strangers.
