The Nigerian Army has said it neutralized 11 members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, who launched an attack on the police command of the Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State on Thursday night. Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General, Mohammed Yerima, in a statement on Friday, said the assailants were members of IPOB’s Eastern Security Network. The statement was titled, ‘Security Forces Foil Another Attack On Police Area Command In Imo State…Eleven IPOB/ESN Terrorists Neutralised, Arms, Ammunition, Operational Vehicles Recovered’. It read, “A gang of IPOB/ESN terrorists mounted in vehicles on Thursday, 6 May 2021, stormed Orlu town with intention to attack the compound housing the Area Command and Police Station in Orlu LGA of Imo State. “The attackers were resisted by vigilant police personnel at the Area Command and were completely obliterated when a reinforcement team of the Nigerian Army and Nigerian Air Force arrived the scene. “The assailants who have been on the radar of the Joint Technical Intelligence Team were said to have come from a Forest Camp in Ideato North LGA of Imo State from where they mobilized and planned the failed attack. “Following the encounter, eleven IPOB/ESN Terrorists were neutralized while four AK47, one G3, and one pump action rifle, as well as a berretta pistol, charms, and assorted ammunition, were recovered.
