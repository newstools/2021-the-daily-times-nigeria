Senator Shehu Sani has stated in a very clearly tone that the President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick and his counterpart in the Nigeria League, Shehu Dikko have not done very much to improve the Nigeria Football brand. Speaking through his twitter handle on Saturday, Sen. Sani wondered why the match between Manchester City versus Chelsea has dominated discuss among the Nigeria football fans while nothing much was been said about a Nigeria Premier league match involving Jigawa Golden Stars taking place in Kaduna state. He was at the stadium to watch the game. He maintained that the Nigeria football Administrators must wake up from their slumber and ensure a proper change of mentality by the Nigeria Football Followers.
