By Mutiat Alli Couples don’t have to give up their passion because of marriage. Instead, marriage should be a catalyst that further inspires them to greater heights. This is the position of musician-cum-songwriter Olorunsogo Michael Oni, who goes by the stage name Musicbysire. The talented musician recently got married to Nollywood actress Aisat Iyabode Asamu, aka Aishy. Said he: “We both are in the creative industry and neither of us has to give up his or her passion because of marriage. Our marriage should further help each of us in our professional pursuits. As they say, iron sharpens iron.” He further added: “One of the major reason for having a partner is support, having someone who can give you a push to improve your craft, skill and profession.
