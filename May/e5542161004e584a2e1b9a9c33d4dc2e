Mrs Adeola Egbebi, an environmental security guard, has collapsed on duty at Oja Oba market in Akure after being reportedly slapped by Dr Doyin Odebowale, the Senior Special Assistant to the Ondo State Governor on Special Duty. According to SunshineTruth, Odebowole allegedly attacked the heavily pregnant worker for not standing up to greet him like her other environmental staff. “The woman had been working since resuming service, and it was time for the environmental protection guards to leave the Erekesan market when the governor’s SSA Odebowale arrived with his men and began threatening the workers, but Mrs Egbebi was unable to greet him immediately, which enraged the SSA, who gave her a hot slap and she slumped. The most unfortunate thing is that the SSA didn’t even care to take the woman to hospital. It was her colleagues and some good Samaritans that helped us to take her to a private hospital,” a source told SunshineTruth.
