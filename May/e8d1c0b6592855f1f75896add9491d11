By Tom Okpe The All Progressives Congress (APC) congratulates the Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade for his wise and timely decision to leave a dead party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a living and thriving party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). The ruling party commends the patriotic disposition and judgement that shaped Governor Ayade’s decision to join forces with President Muhammadu Buhari  to build a better Nigeria as a member of the APC . The APC is advising the other governors who are stranded in the sinking wreckage of the PDP to exercise the best option of abandoning that vessel. APC in a press statement on Thursday, signed by its Caretaker ExtraOrdinary Convention Planning Committee, (CECPC) James Akpanudoedehe said the party is also urging members of the PDP in the National and State Houses of Assembly who are still hanging on to the sinking party to leave it for good and join the APC, which has been repositioned by the excellent leadership qualities of Governor Mai Mala Buni, the National Chairman of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).
