Kidnapping and banditry, according to the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, are not federal offenses in Nigeria. Lai Mohammed, the Information Minister, made the remark to the media on Tuesday in response to the People’s Democratic Party’s statement on insecurity (PDP). He said, “It’s surprising that a group that has dominated this country for 16 years does not understand that kidnapping and banditry are not federal offenses.” The minister instructed the party to demand that all governments, including those under its jurisdiction, prosecute kidnappers and bandits who have been apprehended. Mohammed said the PDP did not respect its own words, as it played cheap politics while playing the ostrich. He noted that the opposition made wild accusations against the President and his government. “For example, the PDP said the government has refused to engage, and that we were running a ‘government of exclusion’, and not engaging stakeholders.” Mohammed insisted that the current administration has consistently engaged Nigerians on topical national issues, including security, the fight against corruption, terrorism, infrastructure and farmer-herder conflict.
