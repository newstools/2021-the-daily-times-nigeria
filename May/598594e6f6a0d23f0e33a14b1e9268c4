By Tom Okpe, Abuja Peoples’ Democratic Party, (PDP) leader in the House of Representatives stated that muslims arround the globe, particularly Nigeria should imbibe the spirit of love, tolerance and togetherness as they mark the end of the yearly fasting and prayers, Eid Mubarak. The House member, O K Chinda in his Sallah message on Thursday to the muslim faithfuls  for myself and on behalf of Members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus, House of Representatives, “I join well meaning Nigerians to felicitate with Muslim faithfuls across the globe, particularly those in Nigeria, on the occasion of this year’s Eid Mubarak celebration. “I heartily rejoice with our Muslim brethren and urge them to use this special occasion to continue to exhibit the spirit of tolerance, sacrifice, selflessness, mutual love and peaceful coexistence with others.” According to Chinda, I “also urge that this year’s celebration should further afford our Muslim brethren the opportunity continue praying for wisdom and spirit of justice to be bestowed on our Leaders, and for the unity, peace and progress of our dear county, built on just, fair and egalitarian principles. “This is in view of the numerous challenges facing us as a nation, including several killings, kidnappings and the general state of insecurity across the county, coupled with the intractable crisis of leadership, rudderless economy, seeming divisive tendencies occasioned by invidious governmental policies and actions, which have more than ever polarized and weakened our collective drive and nationalist spirit. “Equally, of concern is the need for everyone to continue to stay safe and help stop the spread of the dreaded Corona virus (Covid-19) global pandemic which since early 2020 has continued to ravage several countries of the world, including our dear Nigeria. “I am confident that God is on our side and with us playing our individual and collective selfless and pathrotic roles, we shall triumph in the end.”
