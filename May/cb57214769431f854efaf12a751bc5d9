The Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna, Most Reverend Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso, has accused Nigeria leaders of sleeping on duty and not showing empathy to the plights of the people. Ndagoso stated this while fielding questions from journalists at the 2021 annual Archdiocesan Pastoral council meeting in Kaduna. The bishop’s comment comes against the backdrop of insecurity, kidnapping and killings bedevilling the nation. He said, “It is unfortunate where we have gotten ourselves in this country, to have a leader who is sleeping on duty. I think this is precisely what one can say we have a leader who is sleeping.

We need to hear from our President telling us the concrete steps that he is taking to end this insecurity, we don’t want to be hearing from the spokesperson, we did not vote for him; Nigerians didn’t elect the spokesperson. “President, in civilised countries when two or three are killed, you see them appearing and giving people assurance that he is with them, but here in Nigeria, we have a leader who doesn’t talk who doesn’t care, who doesn’t show any sign of empathy to the people. It is discouraging.” Ndagoso also called on the federal and Kaduna state governments to rescue victims who are still in kidnappers’ dens, lamenting that a priest, Fr. John has been in captivity for over two years. He also called on the government to secure the lives and property of Nigerians, adding that the primary responsibility of every government is to secure the lives and property of its citizens.
