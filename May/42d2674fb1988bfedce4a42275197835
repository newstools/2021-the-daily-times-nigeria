Tunde Opalana, Abuja President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has disclosed that the service chiefs and heads of security agencies would, on Thursday, appear before the Upper Chamber to brief it on efforts to address the spate of insecurity in the country. Lawan made the disclosure in an announcement during the commencement of Tuesday’s plenary proceedings. According to him, the appearance by the service chiefs is in response to a resolution by the Senate last week Tuesday, wherein it was resolved that the service chiefs and other heads of security agencies be invited against the backdrop of heightening insecurity across states of the federation. Lawan explained that the service chiefs were unable to respond promptly to the invitation by appearing today due to an ongoing security meeting at the Presidential villa which is scheduled to end on Wednesday this week. He noted that in view of the development, the service chiefs would, therefore, appear before the chamber on Thursday, May 6, 2021. The briefing on Thursday will create avenue for need assessment with regards to a supplementary budget for the funding of the country’s military which is grappling with the issue of poor funding.
