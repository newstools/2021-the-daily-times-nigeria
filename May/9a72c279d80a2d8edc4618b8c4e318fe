See tweets by Kemi below: Quote BREAKING Outspoken politician Ahmed Gulak has been SHOT DEAD assassination style in OWERRIFlag of Nigeria. He was president @GEJonathanâ€™s aide in the PDP presidency. He was on his way to Abuja when the gunmen struck and killed him. Kemitalksmedia Anyone suggesting that IPOB killed Ahmed Gulak is a slowpoke. Gulak had his own ongoing rift with APC, Okorocha and the Uzodinma/ Emeka drama. He wanted another Northern President. He made his own enemies, created more. May God forgive his sins. Stop using the MSM narrative on IPOB. I SAID Ahmed Gulak got hold of info that Fulani bandits had trailed him to Owerri. When he left Protea hotel, he literally sneaked out without calling police escorts. He took a Uber with two people and that Uber took a back road. 7:20am he was shot when they double crossed cab.

Why did he sneak out and not get police escorts? I have credible intelligence that he may have been moving a large amount of cash. Where is the cash? Who gave Ahmed Gulak the cash? What was it for? Was it being laundered? The particular luggage is missing. Imo @PoliceNG is tight-lipped. Gulak was targeted. Shot in the back of the head execution-style and also in the stomach. No word of the associates and Uber driver that fled. I SAID Ahmed Gulak got hold of info that Fulani bandits had trailed him to Owerri.
