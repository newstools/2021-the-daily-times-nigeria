BY PHILIP CLEMENT, ABUJA The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has denied conducting any recruitment exercise as being circulated in several websites and blogs purportedly associated with the SEC. The Commission in a statement at the weekend said “The attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“the Commission”) has been drawn to several websites and blogs purportedly affiliated to the Commission which is said to be advertising on-going “recruitment exercise” by the Commission. “The Commission wishes to inform the general public that the referenced websites and blogs are fake and that no such recruitment exercise is being carried out. For the avoidance of doubt, the Commission has not advertised any vacancies and is not currently recruiting”. “The SEC therefore strongly advised the general public to disregard the said websites and blogs and the messages being disseminated therein.”
