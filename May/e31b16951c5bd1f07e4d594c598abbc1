According to him, “if l am not satisfied with the reason they are detained l order for their immediate release.” He further disclosed that, “even today (Wednesday) l was at Alausa police station and l found out that some people were detained under court order. I told the DPO (Divisional Police Officer ) the police station is not the prison.” Odumosun noted that, “Lagos State government has given us free test on COVID-19 for suspects.” He said he therefore instructed the DPO if for the sake of COVID-19 he should take the suspects for test And that, “those who test negative should be taken to the prison instead of detaining them in the cell. He said he spends about 20 per cent of the day visiting police stations including weekends and public holidays. He also disclosed that one of his reasons for such visits is to ensure that policemen on duty are performing effectively. “Iif you don’t check these boys (policemen) regularly you will not get the best from them,” he concluded.
