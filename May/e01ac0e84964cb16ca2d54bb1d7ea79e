Mutiat Alli Fast rising Nigerian model Thacutegeminme born Iyomaterie Okeoghene Taiwo has said that she has all the listed qualities of the biblical virtuous woman, however she is not to be taken for granted for possessing such rare features. Speaking on her career and lifestyle, Thacutegeminme hints, “I’m 99% an angel. But that remaining 1% of me, no one should joke with it. It means a lot to me.” “I have a flair for modeling. In fact I know my creativity is inborn. Naturally, I just loved watching fashion shows on television as a kid and also watch and admire my sisters do it. I am from a family of seven where I am the fourth together with my twin brother.” Thacutegeminme, a University of Lagos (UNILAG) undergraduate model, also recalled how her 5.3” height had denied her the opportunity to be a runway model, but luckily for her, she opted for face modelling.

So, I just opted for face modelling instead. “I became interested because I like flashy lifestyles, cameras, photo shoots, and looking different all the time. This is because as a model, it’s like you’re a thousand people in one person and this help increases my self-esteem. This is because I am a shy person growing up,” she said. Regretting that models in Nigeria are not given their dues and appropriately remunerated, Thacutegeminme vowed to change the situation and perception about modelling in the country by giving a voice to all irrespective of status.
