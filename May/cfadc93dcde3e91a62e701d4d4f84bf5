Colombia will no longer act as co-host for the 2021 Copa America, CONMEBOL confirmed on Thursday. The nation had been scheduled to hold the competition alongside Argentina, including the final on July 10 which was to be played in Barranquilla’s Estadio Metropolitano. Ongoing protests against the country’s government forced CONMEBOL to intervene, with the decision coming after a last-ditch effort from Colombia to postpone the Copa until November failed. “With regards to the Colombian government’s formal request to reschedule the Copa America for November, CONMEBOL can reveal the following,” the governing body said in a statement published on its official website. “Due to reasons related to the international competition calendar and tournament logistics, it will be impossible to move the 2021 Copa America to November. “CONMEBOL is grateful for the enthusiasm and commitment shown by the President of the Republic of Colombia, Ivan Duque and his collaborators, as well as by the president of the Colombian Football Federation, Ramon Jesurun, and his team. We are sure that in the future new projects together will emerge for the growth of Colombian and South American football. “CONMEBOL can ensure the playing of the 2021 CONMEBOL Copa America and will reveal in the coming days the relocation of the games that were due to be played in Colombia.”
