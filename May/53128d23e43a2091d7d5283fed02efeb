A medical doctor took to Twitter to complain about a “female ghost” that’s in his house and uses his things. Dr Maxvayshia said the ghost slams his door, uses his shower, cleans her body with his towel, and also wipes her makeup on his clean T-shirts. He shared a photo of one of his T-shirts smeared with what appears to be makeup. He then issued a warning to the ghost, writing, “I don’t know what u are all about.

You don’t get to do what u want…” READ ALSO: Borno shuts colleges after students’ clash Dr Maxvayshia seems to believe so much in the supernatural as this isn’t the first time he has tweeted about ghosts.
