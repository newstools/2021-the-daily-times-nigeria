After killing him, they took his girlfriend (who had earlier written in a statement that she was from Lagos) to the motorpark and gave her money to leave Delta state and never return.

Unfortunately for the policemen, the girlfriend of the deceased didn’t travel but instead went back and informed TJ’s friends about the whole ordeal. The police denied that such ever happened until they were petitioned by a lawyer and they said he died from an ailment,” a source said.
