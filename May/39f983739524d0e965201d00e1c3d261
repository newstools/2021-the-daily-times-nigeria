*Demands transparent online voters registration Tunde Opalana, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has told the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that the commission will have no excuses not to use the electronic direct transmission of results in the 2023 general elections and other coming polls. The party’s position was predicated on INEC’s announcement of its readiness to conduct online (electronic) registration of voters for future elections in the country. The PDP noted that since INEC is now in the position to deploy technology to conduct online registration of voters, which entails electronic transmission of voter’s data to its central server, the commission can also conduct an electronic transmission of results directly from the polling unit to its central server. National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement yesterday called the attention of the commission to the fact that it no longer has any excuse not to employ the direct transmission of results from polling units, which will ensure credible elections by eliminating manipulations, alterations, switching and disappearance of election results during manual collation processes. “The PDP insists that if INEC can use the electronic platform for registration of voters it could as well deploys the same technology for electronic transmission of results in future elections including the 2023 general elections. “Our party however urges INEC to ensure that the online registration of voters is credible, transparent and not open to the manipulations of desperate politicians, particularly in the All Progressives Congress (APC)”, he said. The PDP also called on the APC leadership in the National Assembly to know that it has no further pretext to continue to sit on the Electoral Act amendment bill and frustrate genuine effort to ensure credible, free and fair elections in our country. “The party invites Nigerians to note that the only reason the APC-led administration as well as the APC leadership in the National Assembly have been using every available means to frustrate the electronic transmission of result, is that they have realized that there is no way their party can win in a transparent, free and fair election at any level in Nigeria. “We therefore urge Nigerians to intensify their efforts in the collective quest to rescue our country from misrule by adding their voices to the demand by our party for electronic transmission of results in future elections and particularly, the 2023 general elections”, the statement read..
