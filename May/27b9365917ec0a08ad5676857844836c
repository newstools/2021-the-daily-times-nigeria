Paul Onuachu, the Super Eagles striker, has won the Belgian Jupiler Pro League’s Best Player and Golden Bull (highest scorer) awards, capping off an incredible season in which he scored 33 goals and provided three assists for KRC Genk, who finished second on the list. Following a stunning 2020/2021 campaign in which the 26-year-old scored goals in 38 league matches and play-offs, he was awarded the prize on Monday night at the Belgian Pro League Awards traditional gala held at the JAM hotel in Brussels. “Paul Onuachu can call himself the Professional Footballer of the Jupiler Pro League for a year,” the league wrote on its website. “The KRC Genk striker was voted as the best player of the past season by his colleagues. Onuachu scored 33 times last season, making it the player with the most goals behind his name.” After defeating Noa Lang of Club Brugge and Raphael Holzhauser of Beerschot, the imposing striker, who made headlines all season, bulldozed his way to the awards. He’s also up for the Ebony Shoe Award for the league’s Best Player of African Descent, where he’ll face Congolese-born Belgian striker Theo Batombo Bonganda; Angola’s Club Brugge defender Clinton Mata; Anderlecht’s Anglo-Nigerian forward Lukas Nmecha; and Congolese-born Belgian star Sambi Lokonga, who plays for Anderlecht. Onuachu, who previously played for FC Midtjylland, scored 35 goals in 41 games for the Blue-White in all competitions, helping them win the Belgian Cup in spectacular fashion. Prior to this, he and a friend, Bryan Heymen, were named to the Belgian Pro League Team of the Season.
