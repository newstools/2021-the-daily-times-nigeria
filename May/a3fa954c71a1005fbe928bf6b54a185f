By Tunde Opalana A recently renovated office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Ohafia Local Government Area has been set ablaze. The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the State, Dr. Joseph Iloh, reported that the incident occurred late on Sunday night, 9th May 2021. He said there are no casualties on the part of its staff on guard duty but the building was virtually destroyed. Apart from furniture items, all electoral materials and office equipment were destroyed. National Commissioner & Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Barrister Festus Okoye made this known in Abuja on Monday after a meeting of the Commission in which a wide-range of issues, including a disturbing report from Abia State were discussed. The matter, he said, has been reported to the police for investigation.

Five months ago on 13th December 2020, the INEC LGA office in Aba South was completely burnt down while that of Arochukwu LGA was vandalised and ransacked in October 2020. “These facilities are national assets, which must be protected. Accordingly, the Commission is convening an emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) next week to discuss this disturbing trend. “It will be recalled that only last week, the Commission reported an attack on its office in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and expressed anxiety about the impact of such attacks on electoral activities, including the ongoing expansion of voter access to Polling Units, resumption of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), pending bye-elections, end-of-tenure elections and ultimately the 2023 General Election”. Meanwhile, the Commission reassured Nigerians that all activities in relation to the ongoing expansion of voter access to Polling Units and preparations for the resumption of CVR as well as all scheduled elections will proceed as planned.
