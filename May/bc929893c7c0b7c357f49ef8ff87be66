The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has opened an investigation into an alleged criminal scheme, misuse of office, fund diversion, and bribery case involving the Peoples Democratic Party. On charges of criminal conspiracy, misuse of office, theft of funds, and bribery, the anti-corruption agency summoned the National Auditor, Adamu Mustapha, the National Organising Secretary, Austin Akobundu, and the director of finance of the main opposition party. According to the Peoples Gazette, the EFCC will question one of the PDP’s top leaders on Wednesday. “Please release the underlisted officers of your party to attend an interview with the undersigned on the below-scheduled dates, at Economic Governance Section 2, EFCC Headquarters,” the letter requested of PDP National Chairman Uche Secondus. Michael Welcas, the commission’s Head of Operations, signed the note, which was dated May 17 and addressed to Secondus. The interviews will take place between May 19 and May 21 at the commission’s headquarters. The EFCC asked PDP officers to “come along with relevant documentation relating to the selling of forms into the party’s elective positions from January 2017 to date,” according to the paper. The Gazette announced in February that the PDP’s National Working Committee, led by Secondus, had been accused of misappropriating funds since taking office in December 2017. In a memo circulated by members at a committee meeting, the party’s auditor, Mustapha, accused the NWC. Mustapha said that over N10 billion in revenue had gone missing since Secondus became chairman. He also made claims about overpriced printing contracts. According to him, the contract’s actual expense, which was awarded at N630 million, did not exceed N150 million. The auditor claimed that his department’s inability to function as mandated by the constitution prompted his outrage, claiming that the department lacked access to inputs that would enable it to carry out its responsibilities.
