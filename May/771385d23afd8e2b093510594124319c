Hon. Ndudi Elumelu. The governor, while describing Elumelu as a true representative of the people in the area of empowerment and legislation, addes that the lawmaker was a vibrant voice for the PDP and the country. He said, “The empowerment of 456 beneficiaries in small and medium scale enterprises was an enviable. The other representatives at the federal and state levels should toe the line of Hon.

There is no doubt that what we are witnessing here this morning is something to talk about. He further stressed, “Many times our people are elected into offices and we find it difficult to reach out to them, especially when they are in Abuja, but for Rt. Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, he is different. “He is very active in the House of Representative and we have seen it through the number of Bills and motions he has sponsored and co-sponsored. We have seen him rise to speak for the PDP in national matters at the House. “Today, we are witnessing another aspect of that representative democracy because he remembers that he has a covenant with the people. It is important that we politicians play our individual roles in order to help uplift one another in our society”, he emphasized. “One thing that has endeared Ndudi Elumelu to us is that he has constantly been in touch with us. It is important that when you are in Abuja, you should keep in touch with the state government so as to know which direction the state is going. “Ndudi Elumelu has done a lot as a Representative. Starting from his 150 personal Assistants to helping with the capacity building programmes for newly elected council chairmen and 80 councilors, helping to obtain CBN loan for about 300 of our people and many more,” the governor said.

He disclosed “The people can only be happy and fulfilled when value is being added to their lives by way of providing self-sustaining incentives to boost their productivity, to at least, enable them meet their basic needs and those of their immediate relations. As a representative of the people in the House of Representatives, made possible by their (the peoples) cherished mandate, he said, he has continued to strive towards making his constituents feel the impact of representative democracy, thereby putting smiles on their faces. According to him, “The people have remained the focal point in all my activities and actions as their representative, and with all sense of responsibility, I have been committed to empowering, developing and uplifting the standard of living of my people through robust representation. “I had remained resolute and passionate in the implementation of the social contract I entered with my people, pointing and I have to this end, employed over 150 Personal Assistants (PAs) on youth and women matters”.
