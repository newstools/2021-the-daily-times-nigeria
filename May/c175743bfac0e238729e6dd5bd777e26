The responsible looking woman who could not reveal the identity of her child lamented that even the males students were seriously molested sexually. “You know what, from what they said, you cannot say no to them. On daily basis they were having sex with the male and female students of their choice even with severe injuries been sustained”, she regretted. She continued with rolling cheeks, that “You need to hear from them. It’s pitiful and an experience that nobody would like to share. Some of them said they prefer to cease to exist at a point. They were taking them out one after another without their conscience and using them. But we thank God,”, she lamented.
