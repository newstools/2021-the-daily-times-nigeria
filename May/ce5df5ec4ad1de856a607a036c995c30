The US is currently experiencing fuel scarcity and people are already panic buying. The fuel scarcity is due to a shutdown of the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline by hackers. Gas stations from Florida to Virginia began running dry and prices at the pump rose on Tuesday, May 11, as the shutdown of the biggest U.S. fuel pipeline by hackers extended into a fifth day and sparked panic buying by motorists. Some US citizens were seen buying fuel in plastic bags and kegs. Also, there were long queues at gas stations in the US. Ashish Desai, an employee at BP station in Charlotte, North Carolina, said Tuesday was chaotic. “We had people waiting before we even got here,” Desai said, adding that cars began lining up around 6:30 a.m. READ ALSO: Nigerians are angry at Buhari’s govt, Okorocha says ‘poverty’ is reason 75% He said a handful of pumps were shut down around 2 p.m., but eventually they were all closed and it was unclear when the next fuel delivery would be made. “It could be tomorrow; it could be next week.
