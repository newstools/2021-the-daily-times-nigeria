According to the Daily Trust, the 27 students kidnapped by bandits from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Afaka, Kaduna State, have been released. The Sheikh Ahmad Gumi dialogue committee arranged the students’ release, according to one of those who received them, with former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s support. The students were among 37 people kidnapped nearly two months ago.
