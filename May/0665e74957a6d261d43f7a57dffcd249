A blogger, Fred Duni has apologized over his story on a Nigerian politician, Kelvin L. Gabriel, early this month. Retracting the report, he said: “I was contacted over the phone by persons that I cannot ascertain their identities who claimed they represent a group of politicians that are in need of my services. To this end, I was instructed to publish a material entitled: “Nigerian Official, Kevin Luciano Gabriel Implicated in Wire Fraud,” and to also disseminate or widely circulate this libellous material through various online platforms.
